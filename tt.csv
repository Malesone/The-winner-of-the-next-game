0,2019-08-30,Bologna,Lecce,"Bologna and SPAL face each other at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign. The Rossoblu played out a 1-1 draw with Verona in the “City of Love” in their opener, with the match being marked by Sinisa Mihajlovic’s return. The Serbian coach is still recovering from an acute leukemia, but he obviously wants to help his team by being present on every single match. 

Bologna fans are likely to pack Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on Friday evening and seeing that SPAL experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2 loss to Atalanta in the opening match of the season, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s charges. In their last meeting in Bologna in the national championship SPAL emerged triumphant, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge. ",V
1,2020-07-12,Genoa,Spal,"Genoa will be looking to make amends for a 2-1 loss to Napoli when they host SPAL at their Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The Rossoblu aim to escape the relegation zone, and they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. Even though the likes of Criscito, Lapadula, Radovanovic, Romero and Salcedo Mora are likely to miss the game with injury, home win should be considered. 

SPAL, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the table, and they have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival. Considering that the Gli Spalini are not regarded as good travellers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. The good news for the visitors is that defender Thiago Cionek returns to contention after missing the Udinese game through suspension.",V
2,2020-07-12,Cagliari,Lecce,"Cagliari and Lecce, the two teams from the south, take on each other in a highly-anticipated game at Sardegna Arena. The Sardinians did well to hold Fiorentina to a goalless draw in midweek, with the team retaining their spot in top ten. Cagliari aim to move a little closer to the Europa League berth, and the good news for the hosts is that defender Andrea Carboni returns from suspension.

Lecce, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Lazio, and they managed to get one. The Giallorossi proved their worth in the triumph over the title-chasing side, with the team regaining a much-needed confidence. However, Lecce are not regarded as good travelers, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Cagliari’s party at Sardegna Arena. Lecce midfielder Panagiotis Tachtsidis returns to contention after missing the Lazio game through suspension. ",V
3,2020-07-12,Napoli,Milan,"All eyes will be on Stadio San Paolo when Napoli and Milan face each other in the Serie A derby. Napoli quickly bounced from the back, with the team recording back-to-back wins over Roma and Genoa in the previous two league fixtures. The Neapolitans have already booked their place in the Europa League thanks to the triumph in the Coppa Italia final, but they obviously want to finish the season in style. 

Seeing that both Demme and Koulibaly return from suspension for Genaro Gattuso’s troops, home win should be considered. The Rossoneri came from behind to beat their bitter rivals Juventus 4-2 in the Serie A derby. Milan are eyeing a place in European competitions, but given Napoli’s form after the coronavirus football break, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. The likes of Castillejo, Duarte, and Musacchio are all sidelined with injury for the visitors. ",V
4,2020-07-16,Torino,Genoa,"Genoa desperately needed a win against SPAL, and they managed to get one. The Rossoblu picked up vital three points in their battle for survival, but they need to keep on impressing in the season finale if they are to avoid relegation to Serie B. Genoa are high on confidence ahead of the relegation six-pointer against Torino, but beating Il Toro on the road is easier said than done.

Moreno Longo’s men are eager to secure the Serie A survival as well. Torino did well to beat Brescia 3-1 in their last home fixture, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of the visit of Genoa. The good news for the hosts is that experienced attacker Simone Zaza returns from suspension. Anyhow, both teams to score betting option should be considered as both sides are likely to go for a win in the midweek fixture.",N
5,2020-07-16,Spal,Inter,"Stadio Paolo Mazza will host Thursday’s football match between SPAL and Inter. SPAL head into the match following a 2-0 loss to Genoa. The Gli Spallini failed to impress in the relegation six-pointer, with the team extending their losing run in the Serie A to three games. Considering that the hosts are low on spirits ahead of the visit of Inter, home win should not be considered. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to melt Juve’s advantage in the Serie A standings. Inter are eyeing their fourth consecutive win over SPAL, and given the home team’s current form, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Antonio Conte’s troops. Key attacker Romelu Lukaku is rated doubtful for the midweek clash. If he fails to recover in time to face SPAL, Chile international Alexis Sanchez will start the match. ",P
6,2020-07-29,Udinese,Lecce,"Buoyed by back-to-back wins over Juventus and Cagliari, Udinese will be looking to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they welcome Lecce at their Dacia Arena. The Zebretteare eyeing a top-ten finish, and we are positive that they will go for a win in Wednesday’s football match. Lecce, on the other hand, have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival as they are four points behind the “safe zone” ahead of the trip to Udine. 

The Giallorossi have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Udinese, meaning that the hosts will have a number of opportunities to score on the break. Even though the visitors want this win more than the hosts, we are tempted to put our money on the in-form Zebrette. Troost-Ekong is banned for the hosts, while Teodorczyk, Mandragora, Jajalo, and Prodl are sidelined with injury for the home side, while Deiola is the only absentee in the away team. ",V
7,2020-07-29,Hellas Verona,Spal,"Hellas Verona will be aiming to bounce back from a massive 5-1 defeat to Lazio when they host Spal at their Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi. The Mastini do not seem to be on top of their game ahead of Matchday 37, with the team failing to win the last seven league fixtures, but they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. Even though Adjapong, Dawidowicz, Pazzini, and Kumbulla are out of contention with injury, home win should be considered. 

Spal, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the standings, with the team collecting only 20 points from possible 108. The rock-bottom side failed to secure the Serie A survival, and seeing that Hellas Verona are eager to return to winning ways, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. Bonifazi is banned, while Castro, Cerri, Sala, Berisha, and Floccari miss the game with injury.",V
8,2020-07-29,Torino,Roma,"Stadio Olimpico di Torino will host Wednesday’s football game between Torino and Roma. Il Toro dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with rock-bottom Spal, with the team remaining in the 16th position in the standings. Considering that Torino have already secured the Serie A survival, we do not believe that home win should be considered. The Giallorossi, on the other hand, scored a late winner from the penalty spot to beat Fiorentina at Stadio Olimpico. 

The Romans aim to clinch 5th position in the standings, and given the lack of motivation in Torino’s dressing room, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the capital club. The likes of Ibanez, Mirante, Under, Santon, and Fazio are sidelined through injury for the visitors, while Baselli and De Silvestri are injured for Il Toro. Experienced attacker Edin Dzeko is likely to lead the line for the Giallorossi.",P
9,2020-08-02,Spal,Fiorentina,"After rolling over Bologna 4-0 on Matchday 37, Fiorentina will be looking to finish the season in style when they take on Spal at Stadio Paolo Mazza. The Viola are eager to secure a top-ten finish, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the rock-bottom side. Seeing that boss Giuseppe Iachini can count on key players for the last match of the season, away win should be considered. Spal, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-0 loss to Verona. 

Spal head coach Luigi di Biagio has a number of selection worries ahead of the visit of Fiorentina, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the visitors. Luigi di Biagio’s men have not been competitive in the Serie A this term, and it is no wonder they will compete in the Italian second tier next season.",P
10,2020-08-02,Bologna,Torino,"After suffering a heavy 4-0 loss at Fiorentina, Bologna will be aiming to return to winning ways in the Serie A when they welcome Torino at their Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on the last day of the season. The Rossoblu experienced all sorts of problems at the back in their last league match, but they are surely capable of matching Torino at home ground. Experienced attacker Rodrigo Palacio returns to contention after serving his ban against Fiorentina. Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 3-2 loss to Roma. Torino have been struggling to find their best form of late, and it is no wonder they are seen as underdogs in Sunday’s football game. Even though Tomas Rincon is back from suspension for the visitors, we are tempted to put our money on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops. In the first half of the season Torino emerged triumphant, meaning that Bologna are hungry for revenge.",V
11,2020-08-02,Genoa,Hellas Verona,"Genoa will be looking to earn vital three points in the relegation battle when they take on Verona on the last day of the season. Despite suffering a massive 5-0 defeat to Sassuolo on Wednesday evening, the Rossoblu are still on the right track to secure the Serie A survival. Seeing that a win over Verona will see Genoa secure the elite division survival, we are positive that Davide Nicola’s troops are going to leave their hearts on the field. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, head into the match following a routine 3-0 win over SPAL. Verona aim to overtake Sassuolo in the 8th position in the standings, but given the importance of the match for the relegation strugglers, the visitors are likely to return to the “City of Love” empty-handed. Even though Genoa boss Davide Nicola will watch the game from the stands (suspension), home win should be considered.",V
