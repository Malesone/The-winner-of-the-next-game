0,2022-04-24,salernitana,fiorentina,"Buoyed by a 2-1 win over Sampdoria, Salernitana will look to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Fiorentina on Matchday 34. The rock-bottom side are nine points behind the safe zone, meaning that this has to go down as yet another must-win game for them. Keep in mind, though, that the likes of Ruggeri, Sepe, Coulibaly, Mousset, and Obi are out of contention through injuries. 

The Viola, on the other hand, look unstoppable at the moment, with the team eyeing a spot in European competitions. Fiorentina are more of a team than Salernitana, and we predict that the visitors will pick up all three points from Sunday’s showdown. Castrovilli remains on the sidelines with injury, while Bonaventura faces race against clock to be fit for the match. In the first half of the season Fiorentina outclassed Salernitana 4-0. ",P
1,2022-04-24,bologna,udinese,"Stadio Renato Dall’Ara will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Bologna and Udinese. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men were on the verge of beating Juventus in Turin, but the Bianconeri eventually scored a late equalizer. The Rossoblu aim to overtake Udinese in 12th place, but this game will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. Keep in mind that all Medel, Arnautovic, and Soumaoro miss out through suspension. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, are on a three-match winning run in the Italian top flight. However, the share of spoils is on the cards this time out as Bologna are tough to beat in front of home fans. As for the visiting side, all Beto, Pereyra, and Santurro are sidelined with injuries. In the first half of the season the two teams played out a 1-1 draw at Dacia Arena.",N
2,2022-04-24,empoli,napoli,"Stadio Carlo Castellani will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Empoli and Napoli, the two teams who sit in the opposite halves of the table. Empoli made a promising start to the season, but they have been anything but impressive in 2022. Anyhow, the Azzurri are on the right track to secure the Serie A survival as they are 12 points clear of the relegation zone. All Marchizza, Haas, and Tonelli are out of contention with injuries, speaking of the home team. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Roma. Luciano Spalletti’s troops dropped two points at the weekend, and, as a result, this has to go down as a must-win game for Lorenzo Insigne and Co. Since the title-chasing visitors want this triumph more than the mid-table hosts, away win should be considered. Centre-back Koulibaly is sidelined through suspension, while both Di Lorenzo and Lobotka are major doubts.",P
3,2022-04-24,genoa,cagliari,"Genoa will look to keep their survival hopes alive when they take on Cagliari at Stadio Luigi Ferraris on Matchday 34. Alexander Blessin’s troops are on a three-game losing run, but this seems like a good opportunity for the hosts to get back on course. All Sturaro, Vanheusden, Cambiaso, and Rovella are sidelined through injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Sassuolo, and they managed to get one thanks to Alessandro Deiola’s goal. Cagliari, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and given the importance of Sunday’s game for Genoa, we predict that the visiting side will return to Sardinia empty-handed. Lovato misses out through suspension, while the likes of Nandez, Goldaniga, Strootman, Obert, and Ceppitelli are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the away team. ",V
4,2022-04-24,lazio,milan,"All eyes will be on Stadio Olimpico when Lazio and Milan square off against each other in the Serie A round 34. The Biancocelesti dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Torino, and, no doubt, they want to return to winning ways as soon as possible. A man to watch in the home team will be Ciro Immobile, who scored a late equalizer at the weekend, while Pedro faces race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s clash. 

Patric, who limped off with injury against Il Toro, is definitely out of contention. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, recorded a routine 2-0 win over Genoa to retain top position in the standings. The league leaders, though, will have a much bigger fish to fry in the “Eternal City”, and we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on draw. All Ibrahimovic, Florenzi, Kjaer, and Castillejo should miss out with injuries, while both Gabbia and Romagnoli are major doubts. ",N
5,2022-04-24,sassuolo,juventus,"Monday’s football game between Sassuolo and Juventus will bring down the curtain on the Serie A round 34. Sassuolo aim to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Cagliari, but they will have a big fish to fry against Juve. Right-back Jeremy Toljan, who limped off with injury at the weekend, is a major doubt, as well as key player Domenico Berardi. Both Harroui and Obiang remain in the treatment room. 

Anyhow, the fact that the Neroverdi defeated Atalanta in their last home fixture is surely giving fans a reason for optimism. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 1-1 draw with Bologna, which is probably the main reason why we are going to put our money on draw. As for the away side, all McKennie, Chiesa, Locatelli, and Kaio Jorge remain on the sidelines with injuries.",N
6,2022-04-27,fiorentina,udinese,"Fiorentina will look to make amends for an unexpected 2-1 loss to Salernitana when they take on Udinese in a postponed fixture. The Viola aim to climb to the Europa League berth, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at the Zebrette. Both Riccardo Saponara and Krzysztof Piatek are pushing for a start, while both Castrovilli and Torreira continue to miss out with injuries. Udinese, on the other hand, are stuck in the middle of the table. 

Considering that the Zebrette have little to play for in the season finale, we are tempted to put our money on Fiorentina, who are eyeing a top-six finish. There are no fresh injury worries in the away team ahead of the trip to Florence. In the first half of the season the Viola emerged triumphant thanks to Dusan Vlahovic’s goal, but the Serbian superstar is no longer part of the team. ",V
7,2022-04-27,salernitana,venezia,"There will be fireworks when Salernitana and Venezia face each other in a highly-anticipated relegation-six pointer. I Granata were in a fine form in late April, with the team keeping their survival hopes alive. Salernitana are eager to escape the relegation zone, and they should take advantage of Venezia’s poor form. All Coulibaly, Radovanovic, and Obi remain in the recovery room, while the likes of Ribery, Mousset, and Florillo have overcome their respective injuries. 

I Lagunari, on the other hand, made a promising start to the season, but they have been totally out of form in 2022. Since Venezia extended their losing run to nine games at Juventus, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. As for the visiting team, important midfielder Antonio Vacca limped off with injury in the 2-1 loss to Juve, with Romero, Lezzerini, Ebuehi, and Modolo missing out as well. ",V
8,2022-04-27,atalanta,torino,"Atalanta will be aiming to build on a 3-1 win over Venezia when they face Torino in a postponed Serie A game. The Orobici quickly bounced back from a 2-1 loss to Verona, with the team putting an end to their three-game losing run. Atalanta aim to keep their Europa League hopes alive, and they have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Torino. The attacking partnership of Zapata and Muriel seemed to be in a perfect working order against Venezia, and the duo is likely to prove a handful for Il Toro back-line as well. 

Keep in mind, though, that all Toloi, Pezzella, Malinovsky, Cabezas, and Maehle have been struggling with injuries of late. Ivan Juric’s men, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over Spezia at the weekend, but given their anything but good away record, home win should be considered. To make things even worse for the visitors, key attacker Andrea Belotti remains in the recovery room. ",V
9,2022-04-27,bologna,inter,"Bologna and Inter go head to head at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in what is expected to be an interesting Serie A game. The Rossoblu are undefeated in the previous four league fixtures, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of Wednesday’s clash. Nicola Sansone is pushing for a start after finding the net in a 2-2 draw with Udinese, while both Marko Arnautovic and Gary Medel are back from suspension. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, faced no difficulties in a 3-1 win over Roma, but that did not help them regain top position in the standings. Inter face yet another must-win situation against Bologna and seeing that the Rossoblu head into the season finale with the lack of motivation, away win should be considered. Arturo Vidal should be the only absentee in the away team, while Joaquin Correa is pushing for a start. ",P
10,2022-04-30,napoli,sassuolo,"Napoli will look to make amends for an embarrassing 3-2 loss to Empoli when they host Sassuolo to their Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Saturday afternoon. The Neapolitans aim to put an end to their three-game winless run, and they have no other option but to go all guns blazing at the Neroverdi. Poland international Piotr Zielinski is widely expected to return to the starting XI, while all Di Lorenzo, Elmas, and Lobotka remain in the recovery room. Ghoulam is a major doubt. 

Sassuolo, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Cagliari and Juventus, and seeing that they head into the season finale with the lack of motivation, home win should be considered. As for the visitors, both Toljan and Harroui are sidelined with injuries, while Obiang remains in the treatment room with heart problems. ",V
11,2022-04-30,sampdoria,genoa,"There will be fireworks when Sampdoria and Genoa square off against each other in the Derby della Lanterna on Matchday 35. La Samp failed to win the previous four league fixtures, and as a result, their Serie A status is now in danger. Marco Giampaolo can’t count on injured duo Giovinco – Gabbiadini for the local derby, while Rincon misses out due to accumulation of yellow cards. Conti is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Rossoblu are fighting hard to secure the Serie A survival as well. Genoa desperately needed a win against Cagliari, and they managed to get one thanks to Milan Badelj’s late goal. Anyhow, a close encounter is on the cards at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris, and we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. All Cambiaso, Piccoli, Maksimovic, and Vanheusden continue to miss out with injuries, while there are no suspended players in the away team. ",N
12,2022-04-30,cagliari,hellas verona,"Cagliari will look to collect vital three points in the battle for survival when they face Verona in the Serie A round 35. The Rossoblu suffered a 1-0 loss at Genoa at the weekend, but they are surely capable of matching the Mastini in front of home fans. There are no fresh injury worries in the home team, while Matteo Lovato is back from suspension. Experienced attacker Leonardo Pavoletti is pushing for a start. 

Verona, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Sampdoria. The Mastini have little to play for in the season finale, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. The likes of Pandur, Coppola, and Dawidowicz are all out of contention with injuries for the visiting side. In the first half of the season the two teams played out a goalless draw in “The City of Love”.",V
13,2022-04-30,spezia,lazio,"Stadio Alberto Picco will host Saturday’s Serie A game between Spezia and Lazio, the two sides who sit in the opposite halves of the table. Spezia are eight points clear of the relegation zone, but, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from the Lazio game. Centre-back serves a one-match ban, while the likes of Leo Sena, Reca, Maggiore, and Colley are out of contention with injuries. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from an unlucky defeat to league leaders Milan. The capital club have a chance to climb to the Europa League berth, and they should take advantage of Spezia’s poor form. There are no fresh injury worries in Maurizio Sarri’s team, fit-again defender Luiz Felipe should be recalled to the starting XI. Experienced winger Pedro is pushing for a start as well. ",P
14,2022-05-01,juventus,venezia,"Buoyed by a hard-fought 2-1 win over Sassuolo, Juventus will look to retain their spot in top four when they take on Venezia in Turin on Sunday. The Bianconeri are on the cusp of making it to the Champions League, and a win over Venezia could see them overtake Napoli in third position. Even though all Cuadrado, Arthur, Chiesea, Mckennie, Locatelli, and Kaio Jorge remain in the recovery room, home win should be considered as Venezia are low on spirits ahead of Matchday 35. 

The relegation-threatened visitors are on an eight-game losing run in the Italian top flight; therefore, we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Juve’s party at Allianz Stadium. The likes of Ebuehi, Modolo, Romero, Lezzerini, and Vacca should miss out through injuries, but there are no suspended footballers in the away team.",V
15,2022-05-01,milan,fiorentina,"After surviving Lazio at Stadio Olimpico, Milan will be aiming to retain top position when they face Fiorentina in a highly-anticipated Serie A game. The Rossoneri aim to put icing on the cake on a very successful season, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against the Viola. All Bennacer, Florenzi, and Kjaer continue to miss out through injuries, while talented midfielder Sandro Tonali should keep his place in the starting XI after scoring a late winner in Rome. 

Fiorentina, on the other hand, are eyeing a spot in European competitions. Vincenzo Italiano’s men, though, failed to impress in a 2-1 loss to relegation strugglers Salernitana, which is probably the main reason why we are going to bet on the league leaders. As for the visiting side, both Torreira and Castrovilli remain on the sidelines with injuries. ",V
16,2022-05-01,empoli,torino,"Empoli and Torino square off against each other at Stadio Carlo Castellani in what is expected to be a close Serie A encounter. The Azzurri showed character in their last league match, with the team coming from two goals behind to beat title-chasing Napoli 3-2. Empoli regained a much-needed confidence at the weekend, with the team moving one step closer to securing the Serie A survival, and, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from Sunday’s clash. 

All Tonelli, Haas, and Marchizza remain on the sidelines with injuries, while Bandinelli misses out through suspension. Il Toro, on the other hand, proved their worth in a 2-1 home win over Spezia, but given their anything but good away record, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. Important attacker Andrea Belotti faces race against clock to be fit for the Empoli game.",N
17,2022-05-01,udinese,inter,"Inter will look to stay in a two-horse race with Milan when they take on Udinese at Dacia Arena on Sunday evening. The Nerazzurri proved their worth in a 3-1 win over Roma, but they need to keep on impressing in the season finale if they are to defend the Scudetto. Midfielder Arturo Vidal faces race against clock to be fit for the match, while defender Robin Gosens is definitely out of contention with injury. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, head into the season finale with the lack of motivation. Inter want this win more than Udinese, and we predict that Simone Inzaghi’s troops are going to pick up all three points from the game. Both Santurro and Beto miss out with injuries, while there are no suspended players in the home team. In the first half of the season Inter recorded a routine 2-0 win over Udinese at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.",P
18,2022-05-01,roma,bologna,"After failing to spoil Inter’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, Roma will look to retain their spot in top five when they face Bologna on Matchday 35. The Giallorossi continue with their old habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels, and, as a result, the bookies see them as favourites to win Sunday’s clash. The good news for Jose Mourinho is that both Fuzato and Zaniolo are back from suspensions, but Oliveira is banned for the Bologna game. 

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops, on the other hand, have nothing to play for in the remainder of the season as they are stuck in the middle of the table. Given Bologna’s anything but good away record in Serie A, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on the Romans. Kingsley and Dijks should be the only absentees in the away side.",V

All Pezzella, Maehle, and Ilicic are out of contention, but there are no suspended players in the home team. Salernitana managed to revive their survival hopes thanks to three consecutive league wins. 

The newcomers aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but seeing that Atalanta produced a fine display in a 3-1 triumph over Venezia, home win should be considered.

One of the men to watch in the home team will be summer signing Filip Djuricic, who is eager to impress on his debut at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, while there are no fresh injury worries in Marco Giampaolo’s side. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to build on a splendid 3-0 win over Sassuolo, and even though their injury list is pretty full, we are tempted to put our money on the title-chasing side.

The visitors, on the other hand, quickly bounced back from the Derby della Madonnina defeat, with the team beating Torino thanks to Marcelo Brozovic’s late goal. Simone Inzaghi’s men proved their worth in the Champions League triumph (2-0) over Plzen as well, but beating the in-form Zebrette on the road is easier said than done.

The newcomers, on the other hand, did well to hold Atalanta to a 1-1 draw in Bergamo, but they are still eyeing their first win of the process.
