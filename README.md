# The winner of the newxt match
Football (aka soccer) is one of the most popular sports worldwide. There are plenty of press sources, newspaper articles, news, tweets etc. that discuss football on a daily basis and before matches.

The aim of the project is to define an automatic system to **predict the outcome of the matches** starting from the news concerning the teams involved in the match published in the days and weeks preceding the match. It is also possible to use other statistical data to make predictions regarding matches.

In particular, the project must:
- Choose a source of information from which to draw news for a football season in a league of your choice;
- Collect the actual results of the matches of the season in question;
- Collect other statistical information relating to players or teams
- Use news text analysis in conjunction with statistical sources to predict the outcome of specific matches. The only rule is that **the system can only use information whose date is prior to the match date**.
