Montella’s men have played decently, but the lack of lethality upfront has cost them massively. Roma have enjoyed a good spell of form. The club from the Eternal city sits quite comfortably in the 4th spot, a place which takes them to Champions League next season. Fonseca has managed to reach expectations despite some aging players.
