0,inter,sampdoria,2022-10-29,nan,2022-2023,"Inter will look to extend their winning run to four games when they host Sampdoria to their Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in the Serie A round 12. The Nerazzurri want to move closer to the Champions League berth, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at La Samp. A man to keep an eye on in the home side will be Argentina forward Lautaro Martinez, who scored a brace in a 4-3 win over Fiorentina, while fellow striker Romelu Lukaku has overcome his injury. 

All Brozovic, Dalbert, and Gagliardini remain in the treatment room. The visitors have been showing signs of improvement ever since Dejan Stankovic took over the reins, with the team beating Cremonese on Monday thanks to Omar Colley’s goal. Sampdoria, though, will have a mountain to climb against Inter, who should look much sharper up front with Romelu Lukaku in the starting XI. Harry Winks and Manuel De Luca should be the only absentees in the away team.",V
1,napoli,sassuolo,2022-10-29,nan,2022-2023,"High-flying Napoli will look to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Roma when they face Sassuolo in the Serie A round 12. The Neapolitans are eyeing their eighth consecutive league win, and the bookies see them as hot favourites to pick up all three points from Saturday’s clash as well. Fit-again Nigeria forward Victor Osimhen should keep his place up front after scoring the winner at Stadio Olimpico, while defender Amir Rrahmani continues to miss out with injury. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, came from behind to beat Verona 2-1 on home soil, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in Naples. Luciano Spalletti’s troops are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and we predict that they will give fans yet another reason for celebration this weekend. Gian Marco Ferrari is back from suspension, while both Gregoire Defrel and Mert Muldur remain in the recovery room.",V
2,lecce,juventus,2022-10-29,nan,2022-2023,"After rolling over Empoli 4-0 on Matchday 11, Juventus will look to rejoin Scudetto race when they take on Lecce at Stadio Via del Mare on Saturday. The Bianconeri have been showing signs of improvement of late, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to, at least, secure a top-four finish. Keep in mind, though, that Juve’s injury list is pretty long, including the likes of Ake, Bremer, Chiesa, De Sciglio, Di Maria, Paredes, Kaio Jorge, Peeters, and Pogba. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form, with the team failing to win the previous four league fixtures, and given their display in a 2-0 loss to Bologna, away win should definitely be considered. As for the home side, defender Antonio Gallo returns to contention after missing the last league match through suspension.",P
3,torino,milan,2022-10-30,nan,2022-2023,"Torino and Milan square off against each other at Stadio Olimpico di Torino in what is expected to be one of the most entertaining games of Sunday’s program. Il Toro quickly bounced back from the Turin derby loss, with the team beating Udinese 2-1 on the road, but they face yet another uphill task against the Rossoneri. Ivan Juric should have a full squad to choose from for the Milan game. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are on a quest to defend their Serie A trophy, and their display in a 4-1 crushing of Monza is certainly giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of the trip to Turin. Ivan Juric’s men, though, are tough to beat at home, which is the main reason why we are going to put our money on draw. Defender Tomori is back from the Champions League ban, while all Calabria, Florenzi, Ibrahimovic, Maignan, and Saelemaekers are out of contention with injuries for the away team. ",N
4,spezia,fiorentina,2022-10-30,nan,2022-2023,"Stadio Alberto Picco will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Spezia and Fiorentina, the two teams who are almost level on points in the standings. Spezia do not seem to be at the top of their game, with the team collecting only one point in total from the last four league fixtures, and, as a result, the bookies see them as underdogs in Sunday’s clash. Both Viktor Kovalenko and Simone Bastoni continue to miss out with injuries, but there are no fresh selection worries in the home side. 

The Viola, on the other hand, are eager to put an end to their four-match winless run, and seeing that key defender Nikola Milenkovic made his return from injury in a 4-3 loss to Inter, we are going to bet on the visiting side this time out. Nico Gonzalez, though, is unlikely to feature against Spezia after limping off with injury at the weekend. ",P
5,cremonese,udinese,2022-10-30,nan,2022-2023,"Cremonese will be aiming to make amends for a heart-breaking loss to Sampdoria when they face Udinese in the Serie A round 12. I Grigiorossi are stuck at the bottom with only four points in their pocket, and, no doubt, the lack of confidence should prove to be a big problem for the home side. Both Ionut Radu and Vlad Chiriches are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, are enjoying a very successful first half of the season, with the team sitting in 6th place in the standings ahead of Sunday’s clash. Since Udinese have already recorded three wins on the road this term, we believe that there is a big value in betting Andrea Sottil’s charges. Rodrigo Becao is back from suspension, while Adam Mesina has yet to overcome a knee injury. ",P
6,lazio,salernitana,2022-10-30,nan,2022-2023,"Sunday’s football game at Stadio Olimpico pits together Lazio and Salernitana, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2022/2023 season. The Biancocelesti are eager to stay in the Scudetto race, and we are positive that they will stick to their attacking style of play. In Ciro Immobile’s absence, Felipe Anderson, who found the net in a 2-0 win over Atalanta, should continue to lead the line for the capital club. 

I Granata, on the other hand, have been anything but impressive on the travels this season (0-3-2), and seeing that Lazio have turned Stadio Olimpico into a real fortress, home win should be considered. Both Giulio Maggiore and Franck Ribery are out of contention through injuries for the away team, while Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek should be recalled to the starting XI after coming as a substitute in a 1-0 loss to Spezia.",V
7,empoli,atalanta,2022-10-30,nan,2022-2023,"Empoli and Atalanta go head to head at Stadio Carlo Castellani in the Serie A round 12. The Azzurri experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-0 loss to Juventus, with the team dropping to 12th place in the standings, and they face yet another difficult task against the Orobici. All Ardian Ismajli, Lorenzo Tonelli, and Daniel Akpa continue to miss out through injuries for the home team. 

Atalanta, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-0 loss to Lazio, and it seems as if they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. Luis Muriel is banned for the match, and, in his absence, fellow striker Duvan Zapata is widely expected to lead the line for the away side. In their last encounter at the venue Atalanta rolled over Empoli 4-1, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself.",P
8,hellas verona,roma,2022-10-31,nan,2022-2023,"Verona and Roma take on each other at Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi in what is expected to be an interesting Serie A game. The Mastini have been struggling in the first half of the season, and given their six-game losing run in the Italian top flight, home win should not be considered. Roberto Piccoli limped off with injury in the last league match, with fellow forward Yayah Kallon likely to step up. All Ivan Ilic, Darko Lazovic, Ajdin Hrustic, and Diego Coppola are out of contention with injuries for the home side. 

The capital club, on the other hand, failed to extend their winning run to four games at the weekend, with the team losing the Serie A derby against Napoli. Jose Mourinho’s troops, though, will not have a better chance than this to get back on course, and we predict that they will take advantage of Verona’s shaky defence. All Paulo Dybala, Zeki Celik, and Georginio Wijnaldum are likely to miss the game with injuries.",P
9,monza,bologna,2022-10-31,nan,2022-2023,"Monza will look to recover from a 4-1 loss to Milan when they welcome Bologna to their Brianteo in the Serie A round 12. The Biancorossi aim to return to winning ways as soon as possible, and they are surely capable of matching Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops in front of home fans. Filippo Ranocchia, who scored as a substitute in the Stadio San Siro defeat, is pushing for a start, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

The visitors, on the other hand, continue to rely on fit-again Austria international Marko Arnautovic, who scored his seventh goal of the season in a 2-0 win over Lecce. Bologna, though, often struggle on the travels, which is the main reason why there is a big value in betting on draw. Denso Kasius remains on the sidelines with a calf injury for the visiting team.
