0,sassuolo,inter,2022-10-08,nan,2022-2023,"Following a heart-breaking 2-1 loss to Roma, Inter will look to give fans some cheer when they take on Sassuolo in the Serie A round 9. The Nerazzurri recorded a morale-boosting win over Barcelona on Tuesday, with Simone Inzaghi saving his job, but the former Lazio attacker is still under big pressure. Romelu Lukaku should recover in time to face the Neroverdi, while both Alex Cordaz and Marcelo Brozovic remain on the sidelines with injuries. 

Sassuolo, on the other hand, impressed in a 5-0 win over Salernitana. Alessio Dionisi’s troops aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but seeing that the visitors want this win more than the hosts, we are tempted to put our money on Simone Inzaghi’s men. There are no fresh injury worries in the home team ahead of Saturday’s showdown, while Morocco international Abdou Harroui is pushing for a start.",P
1,milan,juventus,2022-10-08,nan,2022-2023,"All eyes will be on Stadio San Siro when Milan and Juventus square off against each other in the Serie A derby. The Rossoneri quickly bounced back from a 2-1 loss to Napoli, with the team beating Empoli 3-1 on the road, but they do not want to stop now. Milan aim to climb to the Champions League berth, and we are positive that they will go for a win in Saturday’s derby. Keep in mind, though, that the home team’s injury list is pretty long, including the likes of Simon Kjaer, Davide Calabria, Alexis Saelemaekers, Junior Messias, Mike Maignan, Theo Hernandez, Alessandro Florenzi, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

Juve, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-0 win over Bologna where Serbian duo Filip Kostic – Dusan Vlahovic got their names on the scoresheet. The Bianconeri want to keep on climbing the standings, and seeing that they will go for a victory in the Serie A derby as well, both teams to score betting option should be considered. All Marley Ake, Paul Pogba, and Kaio Jorge should miss out with injuries, while Federico Chiesa could play some part after overcoming his long-term injury.",N
2,bologna,sampdoria,2022-10-08,nan,2022-2023,"After suffering a heavy 3-0 loss to Juventus, Bologna will be aiming to escape the danger zone when they take on Sampdoria on Matchday 9. The Rossoblu have yet to find their best form, but it seems as if the will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways as they play host to the rock-bottom side. Sinisa Mihajlovic should have a full squad to choose from for Sunday’s clash. 

La Samp, on the other hand, suffered an embarrassing 3-0 defeat to Monza in front of home fans, and as a result, Marco Giampaolo is no longer in charge of the team. Dejan Stankovic could replace Giampaolo as a new Sampdoria boss, but, taking everything into account, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors, who are on a four-game losing run in the Serie A. Forward Manuel De Luca remains on the sidelines with a meniscus problem. ",V
3,roma,lecce,2022-10-09,nan,2022-2023,"Sunday’s football game at Stadio Olimpico pits together Roma and Lecce, the two teams with entirely different ambitions for the 2022/2023 Serie A campaign. The Romans are eyeing a spot in the Champions League, while the newcomers will give 100% to secure the elite division survival. Jose Mourinho’s troops quickly bounced back from a 1-0 loss to Atalanta, with the team beating Inter on the road on Matchday 8, meaning that they are high on spirits ahead of the visit of Lecce. Tammy Abraham returns to the starting XI, while Paulo Dybala got injured after finding the net in the triumph over Inter. 

All Ebrima Darboe, Georginio Wijnaldum, and Rick Karsdorp should miss out for the hosts as well. The visitors, on the other hand, came from behind to share the spoils with Cremonese at the weekend, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in the “Eternal City”. Since Lecce suffered a loss in each of their last six meetings with Roma at Stadio Olimpico, home win should be considered. There are no fresh injury worries in the away team.",V
4,cremonese,napoli,2022-10-09,nan,2022-2023,"High-flying Napoli will look to build on a splendid 6-1 win over Ajax when they take on Cremonese in the Serie A round 9. The Neapolitans have been impressive in the first half of the season, with the team scoring goals for fun in all competitions, and, as a result, the bookies see them as hot favourites to beat Cremonese on the road. Since attacker Victor Osimhen is the only absentee in the away team, Napoli’s triumph should definitely be considered. 

The hosts, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level as they have yet to record a win in the process. David faces Goliath at Stadio Giovanni Zini; therefore, we are tempted to put our money on the title-chasing visitors. Defender Vlad Chiriches misses the match against his former club with a thigh injury. ",P
5,salernitana,hellas verona,2022-10-09,nan,2022-2023,"After suffering a heavy 5-0 loss at Sassuolo, Salernitana will look to give fans some cheer when they take on Verona in the Serie A round 9. I Granata are low on spirits ahead of Sunday’s clash, and seeing that they conceded 11 goals in total in the previous four league fixtures, home win should not be considered. Both Radovanovic and Bradaric are pushing for a start, while towering centre-back Federico Fazio remains in the recovery room. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, do not seem to be at their sharpest, with the team losing each of their last three league fixtures. Considering that Verona will go for a win in Sunday’s showdown as well, we are tempted to put our money on both teams to score. There are no fresh injury worries in the away team ahead of the trip to Salerno.",N
6,torino,empoli,2022-10-09,nan,2022-2023,"Stadio Olimpico di Torino will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Torino and Empoli, the two teams who were beaten by Napoli and Milan respectively at the weekend. Il Toro are now on a three-game losing run, meaning that they are desperate to grab something from the match. Both Pietro Pellegri and Mergim Vojvoda remain on the sidelines with injuries, while Samuele Ricci is a major doubt. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in the 3-1 loss to the Rossoneri. Empoli aim to escape the danger zone, but beating Torino on the road is easier said than done. A close encounter is on the horizon at Stadio Olimpico di Torino, and we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on draw. All Alberto Grassi, Daniel Akpa, and Ardian Ismajli are out of contention with injuries for the visiting side. ",N
7,monza,spezia,2022-10-09,nan,2022-2023,"Buoyed by a 3-0 win over Sampdoria, Monza will look to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Spezia in the Serie A round 9. The Biancorossi have been showing signs of improvement of late, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to avoid relegation to Serie B. Forward Andrea Petagna continues to miss out with injury, while defender Andrea Ranocchia is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, failed to spoil Lazio’s party at Stadio Olimpico at the weekend. Spezia are not regarded as good travellers, and given Monza’s fine form, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. Defender Arkadiusz Reca and Viktor Kovalenko are out of contention with injuries for the visiting side. ",V
8,udinese,atalanta,2022-10-09,nan,2022-2023,"Dacia Arena will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Udinese and Atalanta, the two teams who sit in the Champions League berth ahead of Matchday 9. The Zebrette came from behind to beat Verona in the “City of Love”, with the team extending their winning run to six games, but they face a difficult task against the Orobici. Adam Masina remains on the sidelines with injury, while fellow defender Leonardo Buta faces race against clock to be fit for the match. 

The visitors, on the other hand, proved their worth in back-to-back wins over Roma (1-0) and Fiorentina (1-0). Atalanta have been impressive at the back of late, and we are positive that they will rely on their rock-solid defence in Sunday’s clash. Anyhow, given Udinese’s splendid form, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. Rafael Toloi is sidelined with injury for the visiting side, while Duvan Zapata should recover in time to face the Zebrette.",N
9,fiorentina,lazio,2022-10-10,nan,2022-2023,"Fiorentina and Lazio square off against each other at Stadio Artemio Franchi in a highly-anticipated Serie A game. The Viola have been having their ups and downs of late, with the team losing to both Bologna and Atalanta, while beating Verona. Fiorentina produce much better showings at home than on the travels, but they will have a mountain to climb in Sunday’s showdown. Luka Jovic is pushing for a start, while Dodo has yet to overcome a calf injury. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, are eyeing their fourth consecutive league win, and given their display in a 4-0 crushing of Spezia, we predict that Giovanni Martusciello’s troops are going to emerge triumphant in the Stadio Artemio Franchi clash as well. With no fresh injury worries to report, Giovanni Martusciello is unlikely to make changes to the team that outplayed the Bianconeri.",P
10,empoli,monza,2022-10-15,nan,2022-2023,"Stadio Carlo Castellani will host Saturday’s football game between Empoli and Monza, the two teams who meet for the first time ever in the Serie A. The Azzurri are eyeing their second win of the season, and it has to be noted that they were more than unfortunate not to beat Torino in their last league match, with Sasa Lukic scoring a late equalizer for Il Toro. Empoli are tough to beat at home, but the game against the in-form Biancorossi will be anything but a walk in the park for Paolo Zanetti’s troops. 

Monza, on the other hand, are on a three-game winning run in the Italian top flight, and they must be high on spirits ahead of the trip to Florence. Anyhow, the share of spoils is on the cards as the Biancorossi failed to beat the Azzurri in the previous four meetings between the two sides at “Carlo Castellani”. All Alberto Grassi, Daniel Akpa, and Ardian Ismajli are injured for the home side, while Andrea Petagna misses out with a muscle problem for the visiting team.",N
11,atalanta,sassuolo,2022-10-15,nan,2022-2023,"Atalanta play host to Sassuolo at their Gewiss Stadium on day 10 of the new Serie A campaign. The Orobici have a chance to overtake Napoli in top position, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Neroverdi. Both Davide Zappacosta and Rafael Toli are sidelined with injuries, while Juan Musso, Duvan Zapata, and Berat Djimsiti are all rated doubtful. 

Sassuolo, on the other hand, produced a fine display against Inter at the weekend, but the Nerazzurri eventually picked up all three points from the match thanks to Edin Dzeko’s goal. Sassuolo, though, are not regarded as good travellers, and we do not believe that they are capable of upsetting Atalanta in Bergamo. The likes of Davide Frattesi, Gregoire Defrel, Domenico Berardi, Hamed Junior Traore, and Mert Muldur should miss out with injuries for the visiting side. ",V
12,torino,juventus,2022-10-15,nan,2022-2023,"There will be fireworks when Torino and Juventus face each other in the Turin derby on Saturday. Il Toro showed character in a 1-1 draw with Empoli, with Serbia midfielder Sasa Lukic scoring the winner in the 90th minute, but the bookies see them as underdogs in the local derby. Head coach Ivan Juric should have a full squad to choose from for the Juve clash. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss to Milan where they failed to create a descent opportunity to score. Max Allegri’s team struggle in the middle of the park, and seeing that Torino are tough to beat at home, we do not believe that the visitors are capable of collecting more than one point from Saturday’s showdown. Angel Di Maria returns from suspension, while all Marley Ake, Mattia de Sciglio, Paul Pogba, and Kaio Jorge are out of contention through injuries. ",N
17,spezia,cremonese,2022-10-16,nan,2022-2023,"Sunday’s football game at Stadio Alberto Picco pits together Spezia and Cremonese, the two bottom-table sides. The Bianconeri aim to make amends for back-to-back losses to Lazio (0-4) and Monza (0-2), and we are positive that they will leave their hearts on the field. Forward Andrea Petagna has yet to recover from a muscle injury, while defender Andrea Ranocchia will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

Cremonese, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level, with the team still eyeing their first win of the process. The newcomers experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Napoli, and we do not believed that they are capable of spoiling Spezia’s party at “Alberto Picco”. Both Jack Hendry and Vlad Chiriches are out of contention with injuries for the visiting side. ",V
16,lazio,udinese,2022-10-16,nan,2022-2023,"After rolling over Fiorentina 4-0 at the weekend, Lazio will look to extend their winning run in the Serie A to five games when they take on Udinese on Matchday 10. The Biancocelesti look unstoppable at the moment, but the Zebrette should not be written off just yet. Ciro Immobile, who scored his sixth goal of the season, should continue to lead the line for the capital club, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

Udinese, on the other hand, looked sharp in front of goal in a 2-2 draw with Atalanta, and given their attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Adam Masina remains on the sidelines with a knee injury, while fellow defender Leonardo Buta faces race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s showdown.",V
14,napoli,bologna,2022-10-16,nan,2022-2023,"After rolling over Cremonese 4-1 on the road, Napoli will be aiming to cement top position in the Serie A table when they take on Bologna on Sunday. The Partenopei have been impressive in the 2022/2023 season despite selling Lorenzo Insigne and Kalidou Koulibaly in the summer transfer window, and they look capable of winning their first Scudetto since 1990. Luciano Spalletti is doing a great job with the league leaders, who are seen as hot favourites to beat the Rossoblu on home soil. 

Defender Amir Rrahmani is sidelined with a groin injury, but Spalletti can count on key players for Sunday’s clash. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men, on the other hand, collected only one point in total from the previous three league fixtures, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered. Charalampos Lykogiannis should be the only absentee in the away side.",V

Defender Federico Ceccherini is banned for the match, but there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, proved their worth in the Serie A derby, with the team recording a routine 2-0 win over Juventus. Stefano Pioli’s men aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and given their current situation in Verona’s dressing room, away win should definitely be considered. Keep in mind, though, that Milan’s injury list is pretty long, including the likes of Simon Kjaer, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Mike Maignan, Alessandro Florenzi, Alexis Saelemaekers, and Davide Calabria.",P
15,inter,salernitana,2022-10-16,nan,2022-2023,"Stadio Giuseppe Meazza will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Inter and Salernitana, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2022/2023 season. The Nerazzurri aim to regain Scudetto, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to meet the goal. Edin Dzeko, who scored a brace in a 2-1 win over Sassuolo, should keep his place in the starting XI, while all Joaquin Correa, Alex Cordaz, and Marcelo Brozovic should miss out through injuries. 

I Granata, on the other hand, defeated Verona at home on Matchday 10, but given their anything but good away record, we are tempted to put our money the title-chasing hosts. You should know that Inter crushed Salernitana 5-0 in their last meeting in Milano. Ivan Radovanovic is banned for the match, while fellow midfielers Giulio Maggiore and Franck Ribery continue to miss out with injuries. ",V

The Giallorossi are eyeing their only second win of the process, but they will have a big fish to fry in Monday’s showdown. Since important midfielder Morten Hjumland misses the match through suspension, we are not tempted to put our money on the home side. 

The Viola, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 4-0 loss to Lazio where they failed to turn their dominance into goals. Fiorentina defeated Lecce in each of their last two meetings at Stadio Via del Mare, which is probably the main reason why away triumph should be considered.

All Angel Di Maria, Mattia De Sciglio, Marley Ake, and Paul Pogba remain in the recovery room, while Friday’s game comes too early for important winger Federico Chiesa, who is back in training. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, aim to build on a win over Monza, but seeing that Juve are eager to rejoin the Scudetto race, home triumph should be considered. As for the away team, all Alberto Grassi, Daniel Akpa, Ardian Ismajli, and Lorenzo Tonelli are out of contention through injuries. ",V

Experienced midfielder Ivan Radovanovic is back from suspension, while both Giulio Maggiore and Franck Ribery continue to miss out through injuries. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team extending their winless run to three games at the weekend.

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Sassuolo and Salernitana. Simone Inzaghi’s troops have been showing signs of improvement of late, and seeing that the hosts will be without Luka Jovic in Saturday’s showdown, away win should be considered.
