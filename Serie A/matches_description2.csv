0,2019-08-30,Bologna,Lecce,"Bologna and SPAL face each other at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign. The Rossoblu played out a 1-1 draw with Verona in the “City of Love” in their opener, with the match being marked by Sinisa Mihajlovic’s return. The Serbian coach is still recovering from an acute leukemia, but he obviously wants to help his team by being present on every single match. 

Bologna fans are likely to pack Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on Friday evening and seeing that SPAL experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2 loss to Atalanta in the opening match of the season, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s charges. In their last meeting in Bologna in the national championship SPAL emerged triumphant, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge. ",V
1,2020-07-12,Genoa,Spal,"Genoa will be looking to make amends for a 2-1 loss to Napoli when they host SPAL at their Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The Rossoblu aim to escape the relegation zone, and they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. Even though the likes of Criscito, Lapadula, Radovanovic, Romero and Salcedo Mora are likely to miss the game with injury, home win should be considered. 

SPAL, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the table, and they have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival. Considering that the Gli Spalini are not regarded as good travellers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. The good news for the visitors is that defender Thiago Cionek returns to contention after missing the Udinese game through suspension.",V

5,2020-07-16,Spal,Inter,"Stadio Paolo Mazza will host Thursday’s football match between SPAL and Inter. SPAL head into the match following a 2-0 loss to Genoa. The Gli Spallini failed to impress in the relegation six-pointer, with the team extending their losing run in the Serie A to three games. Considering that the hosts are low on spirits ahead of the visit of Inter, home win should not be considered. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to melt Juve’s advantage in the Serie A standings. Inter are eyeing their fourth consecutive win over SPAL, and given the home team’s current form, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Antonio Conte’s troops. Key attacker Romelu Lukaku is rated doubtful for the midweek clash. If he fails to recover in time to face SPAL, Chile international Alexis Sanchez will start the match. ",P
7,2020-07-29,Hellas Verona,Spal,"Hellas Verona will be aiming to bounce back from a massive 5-1 defeat to Lazio when they host Spal at their Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi. The Mastini do not seem to be on top of their game ahead of Matchday 37, with the team failing to win the last seven league fixtures, but they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. Even though Adjapong, Dawidowicz, Pazzini, and Kumbulla are out of contention with injury, home win should be considered. 

Spal, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the standings, with the team collecting only 20 points from possible 108. The rock-bottom side failed to secure the Serie A survival, and seeing that Hellas Verona are eager to return to winning ways, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. Bonifazi is banned, while Castro, Cerri, Sala, Berisha, and Floccari miss the game with injury.",V
9,2020-08-02,Spal,Fiorentina,"After rolling over Bologna 4-0 on Matchday 37, Fiorentina will be looking to finish the season in style when they take on Spal at Stadio Paolo Mazza. The Viola are eager to secure a top-ten finish, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the rock-bottom side. Seeing that boss Giuseppe Iachini can count on key players for the last match of the season, away win should be considered. Spal, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-0 loss to Verona. 

Spal head coach Luigi di Biagio has a number of selection worries ahead of the visit of Fiorentina, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the visitors. Luigi di Biagio’s men have not been competitive in the Serie A this term, and it is no wonder they will compete in the Italian second tier next season.",P
