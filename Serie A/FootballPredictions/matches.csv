0,2019-08-24,Parma,Juventus,"Juventus begin the defence of their Serie A trophy at Stadio Ennio Tardini as they take on Parma in the opening match of the season. The Bianconeri are once again considered No. 1 favourites to win the domestic trophy, but it remains to be seen if new coach Maurizio Sarri is going to help Juve defend their title. The likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Danilo, Cristian Romero, Luca Pellegrini, Merih Demiral, Adrien Rabiot and Aaron Ramsey joined the club in the summer transfer window, with experienced goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon returning to Allianz Stadium. 

Parma, on the other hand, aim to secure yet another Serie A survival, but despite bringing the likes of Andrea Adorante, Caston Brugman, Mattia Sprocati, Jose Machin, Roberto Inglese and Hernani to Stadio Ennio Tardini in the summer, we do not believe that the Gli Amiliani are capable of matching the star-studded title holders. ",P,2019-2020
1,2019-08-24,Fiorentina,Napoli,"All eyes will be on Stadio Artemio Franchi when Fiorentina and Napoli face each other in the opening match of the season. Fiorentina kicked off their Coppa Italia campaign with a 3-1 win over Monza, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in Saturday’s football match against Napoli. The Viola failed to impress in the 2018/2019 Serie A campaign and seeing that the club chiefs have not been too active in the summer transfer window, home win should not be considered. 

Napoli owners, on the other hand, did well to reinforce the squad in the summer transfer window and seeing that Carlo Ancelotti’s troops are determined to put an end to Juventus’ dominance in the Italian top flight, we believe that the visitors are going to pick up all three points from the Stadio Artemio Franchi clash. A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Italian attacker Lorenzo Insigne.",P,2019-2020
2,2019-08-25,Udinese,Milan,"Dacia Arena will host Sunday’s football game between Udinese and Milan. The Zebrette have been scoring goals for fun in pre-season, with the team kicking off their Coppa Italia campaign with a 3-1 win over Sudtirol. Udinese are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Milan and seeing that over the years they have turned their Dacia Arena into a real fortress, we predict that the hosts are going to find the net in the opening match of the season. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are eyeing a top-four finish and seeing that they will not represent Italy in European competitions this term, they will be fully focused on the national championship. Given Milan’s attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. In their last meeting in the Italian top flight the two teams played out a 1-1 draw.",N,2019-2020
3,2019-08-25,Roma,Genoa,"Roma kick off the new Serie A campaign with a home game against Genoa. The Romans did well to sign the likes of Leonardo Spinazzola, Pau Lopez, Bryan Cristante, Amadou Diawara, Mert Cetin, Jordan Veretout (loan) and Gianluca Mancini (loan) in the summer transfer window and it is more than obvious that they aim to regain their place in top four. 

The capital club are a real force to be reckoned with at home and seeing that key attacker Edin Dzeko is still part of the team, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are tough to beat at home, but given their poor away record in the Italian top flight, we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Roma’s party at Stadio Olimpico in the opening match of the season.",V,2019-2020
4,2019-08-25,Cagliari,Brescia,"Brescia return to Serie A following an eight-year absence. The Biancazzurri aim to impress on their return to the Italian top flight, but they will have a mountain to climb in Sunday’s football match against Cagliari. 

The Sardinians did well to sign the likes of Nahitan Nandez, Albero Cerri, Fabrizio Cacciatore, Christian Oliva, Federico Mattiello (loan) and Marko Rog (loan) in the summer transfer window and given their fine home record in the Italian top flight, it is no surprise they are seen as favourites to win the opening match of the season. The newcomers, on the other hand, are not regarded as good travelers and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Cagliari’s party at Sardegna Arena. A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be controversial Italian attacker Mario Balotelli, who joined the club earlier this summer. ",V,2019-2020
5,2019-08-25,Sampdoria,Lazio,"Sampdoria and Lazio take on each other at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris in what is expected to be one of the most entertaining games of Sunday’s program. La Samp proved their worth in a 3-1 away win over Crotone in their Coppa Italia opener, but the game against the capital club will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. Fabio Quagliarella is not getting any older and the veteran, who scored 26 goals in the 2018/2019 Serie A campaign, will be the man to keep an eye on in the home team. 

The Biancocelesti did not make too many changes to the squad in the summer transfer window and, no doubt, all eyes will be on Italian attacker Ciro Immobile when Simone Inzaghi’s troops face Sampdoria in the opening match of the season. Anyhow, a close encounter is on the cards in Genoa and we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. ",N,2019-2020
6,2019-08-25,SPAL,Atalanta,"Thanks to a 3-1 win over Sassuolo on the last day of the 2018/2019 Serie A season Atalanta booked their place in the Champions League for the first time ever. The Orobici aim to prepare in the best way possible for their debut in the elite competition, but they first need to kick off the new Serie A season in style. Gian Piero Gasperini’s charges take on SPAL at Stadio Paolo Mazza in their opener and we are positive that the visitors are going to stick to their attacking style of play. 

A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Duvan Zapata, who scored 23 goals in the Italian top flight last term. SPAL played above expectations in the Serie A last season and they surely want to continue where they left. Seeing that Atalanta were struggling in pre-season, we predict that the hosts are going to grab something from Sunday’s football match.",N,2019-2020
7,2019-08-25,Torino,Sassuolo,"Sassuolo will be looking to build on a hard-fought Coppa Italia win over Spezia when they take on Torino at Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino in the opening match of the season. The Neroverdi were producing fine performances in the 2018/2019 Serie A campaign, but they eventually finished the season in 11th place in the standings. 

Sassuolo chiefs were forced to sell Matteo Politano to Inter in the summer transfer window, but they did well to sign the likes of Manuel Locatelli, Pedro Obiang, Francesco Caputo, Rogerio and Marco Sala. Torino, on the other hand, will play on three fronts in the 2019/2020 season, but seeing that the club owners managed to keep hold of key players in the summer, we predict that the hosts are going to grab something from their opener. You should bear in mind that the two clubs shared the spoils in two of their last three meetings in the Serie A.",N,2019-2020
8,2019-08-25,Hellas Verona,Bologna,"Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi will host Sunday’s football game between Hellas Verona and Bologna. The Mastini aim to make amends for an embarrassing 2-1 loss to Cremonese in their Coppa Italia opener and we predict that they are going to leave their hearts on the field in the opening match of the new Serie A campaign. 

It is well known that the newcomers produce much better showings at home than on the travels and that is the main reason why we believe that they are going to grab something from Sunday’s clash. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, faced no difficulties in their Italian Cup opener against Pisa, with the team rolling over Luca D’Angelo’s troops 3-0. However, beating Verona in the “City of Love” is easier said than done, therefore, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. ",N,2019-2020
9,2019-08-26,Inter,Lecce,"Inter play host to Lecce at their Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in the opening match of the 2019/2020 Serie A campaign. The Nerazzurri did well to reinforce the squad in the summer transfer window and, no doubt, Belgian attacker Romelu Lukaku is the club’s biggest signing. The former Manchester United man is expected to impress in the upcoming Serie A season and all eyes will be on him when Inter take on Lecce in their opener. 

Yet another man to watch in the home team will be Matteo Politano, who joined the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza outfit in a €20 million deal. The Salentini, on the other hand, return to the Italian top flight following a seven-year absence and seeing that Antonio Conte’s men are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the newcomers are unlikely to grab something from the match. ",V,2019-2020
10,2019-08-30,Bologna,Lecce,"Bologna and SPAL face each other at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign. The Rossoblu played out a 1-1 draw with Verona in the “City of Love” in their opener, with the match being marked by Sinisa Mihajlovic’s return. The Serbian coach is still recovering from an acute leukemia, but he obviously wants to help his team by being present on every single match. 

Bologna fans are likely to pack Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on Friday evening and seeing that SPAL experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2 loss to Atalanta in the opening match of the season, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s charges. In their last meeting in Bologna in the national championship SPAL emerged triumphant, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge. ",V,2019-2020
11,2019-08-31,Milan,Brescia,"Stadio Giuseppe Meazza will host Saturday’s football game between Milan and Brescia, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2019/2020 season. The Rossoneri suffered a 1-0 loss to Udinese in the opening match of the season, meaning that they are desperate to pick up all three points from the Brescia game. Seeing that key player Mario Balotelli misses the game through suspension for the visitors, we believe that home win should be considered. 

The newcomers did defeat Cagliari in Sardinia in their opener, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza clash. A man to watch in the home team will be Krzysztof Piatek, the Poland international who is eager to open his goal-scoring account. You should know that Milan and Brescia meet in the Serie A for the first time since 2011 when the Rossoneri defeated le Rondinelle. ",V,2019-2020
12,2019-08-31,Juventus,Napoli,"All eyes will be on Allianz Stadium when Juventus and Napoli face each other in the Serie A derby. The Neapolitans are determined to put an end to Juve’s dominance in the Italian top flight and a victory over the Bianconeri will see them keep their hopes of winning the Scudetto alive. The Partenopei recorded a thrilling 4-3 win over Fiorentina on the road in their last league match, but scoring against Juve in Turin is easier said than done. 

Giorgio Chiellini’s goal helped Maurizio Sarri’s men pick up all three points from the opening match of the season against Parma, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry against Napoli. Seeing that the defending champions have yet to find their best form, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw in the Serie A derby. As always, Cristiano Ronaldo will lead the line for the hosts.",N,2019-2020
13,2019-09-01,Lazio,Roma,"There will be fireworks when two bitter local rivals Lazio and Roma face each other in Derby della Capitale on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign. Lazio did remarkably well to roll over Sampdoria in Genoa 3-0 in their opener, with experienced attacker Ciro Immobile scoring a brace. The 29-year-old striker will be the man to watch in the home team in the local derby, but the Giallorossi should not be written off just yet. 

The Romans played out a thrilling 3-3 draw with Genoa in the opening match of the season, with Edin Dzeko opening his goal-scoring account. Both teams are likely to adopt an attack-minded approach in the Stadio Olimpico showdown, therefore, there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. You should bear in mind that 19 goals in total have been netted in previous six meetings between the two local rivals in all competitions.",N,2019-2020
14,2019-09-01,Atalanta,Torino,"Atalanta and Torino take on each other at Gewiss Stadium in what is expected to be one of the most entertaining games of Sunday’s program. The Orobici came from two goals behind to beat SPAL 3-2 at Stadio Paolo Mazza in their opener and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Il Toro. 

Over the years Atalanta have turned their stadium into a real fortress and we are positive that Gian Piero Gasperini’s troops, who will represent Italy in the Champions League this season, will find the net in Sunday’s football match. Torino recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over Sassuolo at home in the opening match of the season and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. A man to watch in the away team will be Simone Zaza, who scored a brace in the 2-1 win over the Neroverdi.",N,2019-2020
15,2019-09-01,Cagliari,Inter,"Cagliari will be looking to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Brescia when they welcome Inter at their Sardegna Arena on Sunday evening. The Sardinians are eager to record their first win of the season, but they face an uphill task in the clash against the star-studded Nerazzurri. Inter chiefs did remarkably well to reinforce the squad in the summer transfer window and we predict that powerful Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku is going to make life difficult for the opposition defenders. 

Antonio Conte’s men are determined to put an end to Juve’s dominance in the Serie A and we are positive that the visitors will go all guns blazing at the Rossoblu on Matchday 2. Yet another man to watch in the away team will be Argentine attacker Mauro Icardi, who scored 11 goals in the national championship last term.",P,2019-2020
16,2019-09-01,Genoa,Fiorentina,"After playing out a thrilling 3-3 draw with Roma at Stadio Olimpico, Genoa will be looking to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Fiorentina at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris in their first home game of the season. The Rossoblu showed character in their opener, with the team coming from behind to share the spoils with the Giallorossi in the “Eternal City” and they are definitely capable of grabbing something from Sunday’s football game against Fiorentina. 

The Viola experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-3 home loss to Napoli, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on Aurelio Andreazzoli’s troops. Ivory Coast rising star Christian Kouame, who found the net in the 3-3 draw with Roma, is likely to pose a big threat for Fiorentina defenders. ",V,2019-2020
17,2019-09-01,Lecce,Hellas Verona,"Stadio Comunale Via del Mare will be packed when Lecce and Hellas Verona square off against each other on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign. The Giallorossi are eager to impress in their first home game of the season and they will not have a better chance than this to pick up all three points as Verona are seen as one of the main candidates to suffer relegation at the end of the season. 

The Mastini played out a 1-1 draw with Bologna at home in their opener, with Polish defender Pawel Dawidowicz being sent off after 13 minutes. The 24-year-old is out of contention through suspension and seeing that Verona are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on Fabio Liverani’s charges. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be summer signing Gianluca Lapadula.",V,2019-2020

The Neroverdi continue with their habit of struggling on the travels, but seeing that they are tough to beat at home, we are positive that they are going to grab something from their first home game of the season. Sassuolo were producing fine performances in pre-season, therefore, we predict that they are going to find the net in Sunday’s football game. 

La Samp, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a heavy 3-0 loss to Lazio and seeing that they would be happy with one point from the MAPEI Stadium – Citta del Tricolore clash as well, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw in this one. ",N,2019-2020
19,2019-09-01,Udinese,Parma,"Buoyed by a hard-fought 1-0 win over Italian giants Milan, Udinese will be looking to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they face Parma at their Dacia Arena. The Zebrette proved their worth in the opening match of the season and it is no wonder they are seen as favourites to win Sunday’s football game. 

Summer signing Rodrigo Becao impressed on his Serie A debut as he scored the winner against the Rossoneri, but a man to watch in the home team will be Italian attacker Kevin Lasagna, who has netted 18 goals for Udinese since joining the club in the summer of 2017. Parma, on the other hand, were not capable of matching title holders Juventus in their opener and seeing that they are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the Zebrette. ",V,2019-2020
20,2019-09-14,Fiorentina,Juventus,"All eyes will be on Stadio Artemio Franchi when Fiorentina and Juventus face each other on day 3 of the new Serie A campaign. Fiorentina continue to struggle in the Italian top flight and after failing to impress in the 2018/2019 Serie A season, the Viola suffered back-to-back defeats to the likes of Napoli and Genoa at the start of the new campaign. 

The hosts obviously struggle at the back and seeing that Juventus proved their worth in a 4-3 win over Napoli, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the title holders. Maurizio Sarri’s troops aim to overtake Inter in top position in the standings and given the Viola’s poor start to the season, away win should be considered. Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored for the national team in a 4-2 win over Serbia, will be the man to watch in the away team. ",P,2019-2020

The Neapolitans are determined to get back on course and seeing that Sampdoria made a very slow start to the season, we predict that the hosts are going to pick up all three points from Saturday’s football game. 

Over the years Napoli have turned their Stadio San Paolo into a real fortress, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered. La Samp, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in back-to-back defeats to the likes of Lazio (0-3) and Sassuolo (1-4) and we do not believe that they are capable of shocking the title-chasing team in Naples.

The Nerazzurri head into the match following back-to-back wins over Lecce and Cagliari and it is more than obvious that the club chiefs made a right decision when they signed a deal with Belgian attacker Romelu Lukaku. 

The former Man Utd striker has already netted two goals in the new Serie A season and all eyes will be on him when Inter welcome Udinese at their Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The Zebrette, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 3-1 loss to Parma and we do not believe that they are capable of upsetting the league leaders in Milano.

Genoa are a real force to be reckoned with at home and seeing that they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Atalanta, we are positive that they are going to find the net in Sunday’s football match.

The newcomers are determined to secure the Serie A survival, but seeing that they will be without suspended attacker Mario Balotelli against Bologna, home win should not be considered. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are playing for coach Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is coping with serious illness and we are positive that they are going to leave their hearts on the field. 

Bologna recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over SPAL at home on Matchday 2, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, suffered back-to-back defeats to the likes of Brescia and Inter at the start of the season, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the Gli Emiliani.

Turkey international Hakan Calhanoglu scored the winner for Milan against Brescia, meaning that Hellas Verona defenders should have him at bay.

The Mastini, on the other hand, did remarkably well to beat Elche 1-0 on the road on day 2, meaning that they are brimming with confidence ahead of the visit of the Rossoneri.

Over the years Bologna have turned their stadium into a real fortress and seeing that they showed character in a 4-3 win at Brescia, we are tempted to put our money on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, recorded a routine 4-2 win over Sassuolo at their Stadio Olimpico, but considering that the Romans often struggle on the travels, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the in-form hosts this time out.

The Giallorossi are eyeing their first win of the season, but beating the star-studded Neapolitans is easier said than done. Lecce did not make a flying start to the season and seeing that the Partenopei are eager to put an end to Juve’s dominance in the Italian top flight, we are positive that the visitors will leave their hearts on the field in Sunday’s football match. 

Dries Mertens, who scored a brace in a 2-0 win over Sampdoria and we predict that the Belgium international is going to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. Napoli are more of a team than Lecce, who are likely to find it has to survive in the Italian top flight. ",P,2019-2020
37,2019-09-22,Sampdoria,Torino,"Sampdoria and Torino take on each other at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris in what is expected to be one of the most entertaining games of Sunday’s program. La Samp made a very slow start to the season, with the team suffering a loss in each of their first three league fixtures. Eusebio di Francesco’s troops have been struggling at the back at the start of the season, with the team conceding nine goals to date and seeing that Torino have big ambitions for the 2019/2020 Serie A season, home win should not be considered. 

Il Toro are on a quest to bring glory days back to Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino and seeing that they outplayed Atalanta in Bergamo in their last away game in the national championship, we are tempted to put our money on Andrea Belotti and Co. this time out. ",P,2019-2020
38,2019-09-22,Atalanta,Fiorentina,"Atalanta will be aiming to build on a 2-1 win over Genoa when they face Fiorentina in Bergamo on Matchday 4. The Orobici head into the match following the Champions League clash against Dinamo Zagreb, meaning that tired legs could prove to be a big problem for the home side. The Viola, on the other hand, did remarkably well to hold reigning champions Juventus to a goalless draw at the weekend, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of the trip to Bergamo. 

Atalanta have been scoring goals for fun in the Italian top flight at the start of the season and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Fiorentina. Considering that the visitors should have a number of opportunities to find the net on the break, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. ",N,2019-2020

The Biancoclesti undisputedly produce much better showings at home than on the travels and they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. 

Ciro Immobile scored his third goal of the season in the 2-1 loss to SPAL and all eyes will be on the experienced attacker when Lazio take on Parrma this weekend. Roberto D’Aversa’s troops failed to impress in a 3-1 loss to Cagliari at the weekend and despite the fact that the club chiefs managed to keep hold of Gervinho in the summer transfer window, we are tempted to put our money on the capital club as they are determined to bounce back from the loss to Leonardo Semplici’s troops.",V,2019-2020

Following back-to-back defeats to the likes of Parma and Inter, the Zebrette were beaten by Brescia 1-0 in their last league fixture. Udinese are eager to return to winning ways in the Italian elite division, but beating Hellas Verona in the “City of Love” is easier said than done. 

The newcomers produced a fine performance in a 2-1 loss to Juventus in Turin, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of the visit of the midweek fixture. Anyhow, since both teams would be happy with one point from Tuesday’s football match, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. ",N,2019-2020

The Bianconeri aim to overtake Inter in top position in the Serie A standings and we predict that they will go all guns blazing at Brescia on Matchday 5. Maurizio Sarri’s troops are eager to take on Inter on day 7 with six points in their pocket from matches against Brescia and SPAL. 

Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored from the penalty spot against Hellas Verona, will be the man to watch in the away team. Mario Balotelli returns from suspension for the hosts and all eyes will be on the former Inter and Milan attacker when the two teams face each other at Stadio Mario Rigamonti on Tuesday evening. Anyhow, seeing that Maurizio Sarri can count on key players for the Brescia game, away win should be considered.",P,2019-2020

The Romans have been producing fine performances in all competitions of late and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Atalanta. Paulo Fonseca’s troops are eyeing their third consecutive win in the Italian elite division and given the Orobici’s shaky defence, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the capital club. 

In their last home game in the national championship Roma outclassed Sassuolo 4-2. Atalanta, on the other hand, came from two goals behind to share the spoils with Fiorentina at Stadio Ennio Tardini. The Orobici failed to keep a clean sheet in previous eight games in the Italian top flight and given Roma’s fine form, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed from the trip to the “Eternal City”.",V,2019-2020

The Viola were on the verge of beating Atalanta in Parma in their last league match, but the Orobici eventually scored a late equalizer and picked up one point from the match. Fiorentina are stuck at the bottom of the standings ahead of the visit of Sampdoria, but many people believe that the time has come for Vincenzo Montella’s troops to get back on course. 

A man to keep an eye on in the home side will be Italy international Federico Chiesa, who is likely to pose a big threat for the opposition defenders. La Samp, on the other hand, desperately needed a win over Torino and they managed to get one. Manolo Gabbiadini’s goal helped Eusebio di Francesco’s troops put an end to their three-game losing run in the Serie A, but seeing that Fiorentina want this victory more than Sampdoria, home win should be considered.

Genoa have been scoring goals for fun at the start of the season, but their defence has been pretty shaky of late. Anyhow, given the attacking potential of the home team, we are positive that they are going to find the net in the midweek fixture. 

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops look sharp in front of goal and seeing that they recorded a thrilling 4-3 win over Brescia in their last away game in the national championship, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. In their last meeting in the Italian top flight the two sides played out a 1-1 draw and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. ",N,2019-2020

The Nerazzurri are brimming with confidence following a 2-0 win over Milan in the Derby della Madonnina and Antonio Conte’s troops will be looking to retain top position in the standings with a win over Lazio on Matchday 5. Summer signing Romelu Lukaku has been scoring goals for fun at the start of the new Serie A season and we predict that the former Manchester United man is going to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, recorded a routine 2-0 win over Parmat at their Stadio Olimpico at the weekend, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in Wednesday’s football match against the league leaders.

Summer signing Fernando Llorente has already started paying off and the Spanish attacker, who scored a brace against Lecce, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, proved their worth in back-to-back wins over Parma and Genoa, but beating the Neapolitans on the road is easier said than done. Carlo Ancelotti’s troops are eyeing their first Scudetto since 1990 and we are positive that Lorenzo Insigne and Co. are going to fight tooth and nail against the Sardinians on Wednesday evening.",V,2019-2020

Roberto D’Aversa’s troops aim to move away from the danger zone in the Serie A standings, but the game against the Neroverdi will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. 

Experienced attacker Gervinho, who has netted one goal in four appearances for Parma this term, will be the man to keep an eye on in the home side. Sassuolo, on the other hand, continue with their habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels. The Neroverdi rolled over SPAL 3-0 on home soil at the weekend, but given their poor away record in the Italian top flight, we believe that they are going to share the spoils with Parma on Matchday 5.

The Gli Estensi sit in the danger zone in the Serie A standings ahead of Matchday 5 and seeing that Lecce were outclassed by Napoli (1-4) in their last league fixture, we are positive that the hosts are going to grab something from Wednesday’s football game at Stadio Paolo Mazza. 

The Giallorossi have already suffered three defeats in the new Serie A campaign and seeing that SPAL are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we predict that the newcomers are going to return home empty-handed from the trip to Ferrara.

Milan suffered a heart-breaking 2-0 loss to Inter in the Derby della Madonnina at the weekend, meaning that the lack of confidence could prove to be a big problem for the visitors in the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino clash. Over the years Walter Mazzarri’s troops have turned their stadium into a real fortress and seeing that key attacker Andrea Belotti is likely to keep his place in the starting XI, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the home side.",V,2019-2020

Juve are eager to overtake Inter in top position in the standings and we predict that the title holders will go all guns blazing at SPAL on Matchday 6. In previous two home games in the 2019/2020 Serie A season Maurizio Sarri’s men defeated the likes of Napoli and Hellas Verona. Leonardo Semplici’s troops, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back defeats to the likes of SPAL and Lecce and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Juve’s party in Turin.

La Samp head into Saturday’s football match following a 2-1 loss to Fiorentina and seeing that they will be without suspended defenders Jeison Murillo against Inter, home win should not be considered. Antonio Conte is doing a great job with Inter, who aim to keep their 100% record intact in the 2019/2020 season. 

The Nerazzurri recorded a very important 1-0 win over Lazio in their last league fixture and seeing that Sampdoria do not seem to be on top of their game ahead of the Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris clash, we are tempted to put our money on Romelu Lukaku and Co. ",P,2019-2020

Sassuolo, though, are likely to stick to their attacking style of play and given their splendid home record, we are positive that Roberto de Zerbi’s troops are going to find the net against the Orobici. Atalanta aim to build on a 2-0 win over Roma at Stadio Olimpico and given their attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. 15 goals in total have been netted in previous three meetings between the two clubs and yet another high-scoring affair is on the cards.

The Neapolitans need to pick up all three points from Sunday’s football game if they are to rejoin the race for the trophy, but they will have to do it without key defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who was sent off in the 1-0 loss to Cagliari. 

Anyhow, the Partenopei, who failed to turn their dominance into goals in the midweek fixture, are likely to beat the newcomers at their Stadio San Paolo. Le Rondinelle, on the other hand, produced a fine performance in a 2-1 loss to Juventus, but they were more than unfortunate not to grab something from the match.

Ciro Immobile is likely to lead the line for the hosts and we predict that the Italian veteran is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, played out a goalless draw with Bologna at home in their last league match, with the visitors failing to convert a penalty in the 78th minute.

The capital club aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss to Atalanta and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Lecce. 

Roma did well to beat Bologna 2-1 in their last away game and seeing that key attacker Edin Dzeko is likely to lead the line for the visitors, we are tempted to put our money on Paulo Fonseca’s troops.

Igor Tudor’s troops aim to escape the danger zone in the Serie A standings and we are positive that they are going to leave their hearts on the field against Bologna. 

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops were more than unfortunate not to pick up all three points from a midweek fixture against Genoa as Nicola Sansone missed a penalty in the 78th minute of the match.

The Sardinians are a real force to be reckoned with at home and that is the main reason why we predict they are going to give fans yet another reason for celebration this weekend. 

The Mastini’s main goal is to secure the Serie A survival, but they will have to keep on improving their game if they are to avoid relegation to the Italian second tier.

Fiorentina desperately needed a win against Sampdoria and they managed to get one, but beating the Rossoneri on the road is easier said than done.

Experienced winger Gervinho is still capable of producing fine performances at this level and the former Arsenal footballer will be the man to keep an eye on in the home team. 

Torino, on the other hand, have been having their ups and downs at the start of the season. Il Toro produce much better showings at home than on the travels and seeing that Parma are tough to beat at their Stadio Ennio Tardini, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. ",N,2019-2020

In previous two meetings between the two teams in the Italian top flight SPAL emerged triumphant and that is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

Hellas Verona did well to beat Sampdoria 2-0 at home in their last league fixture, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that home win should be considered.",V,2019-2020

The Bianconeri are eyeing their fifth consecutive win in the Italian top flight and despite the fact that important defender Giorgio Chiellini remains in the recovery room, we are tempted to put our money on the defending champions. 

Miralem Pjanic, who scored a wonder goal for Bosnia in a 4-1 win over Finland, will be one of the men to keep an eye on in the home team. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, did well to hold Lazio to a 2-2 draw at home in their last league fixture, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in Saturday’s football game against Juve. As always, Cristiano Ronaldo will lead the line for the hosts. ",V,2019-2020

The Nerazzurri dropped to second place in the standings, but since a win over Sassuolo could see them overtake Juve in top position in the table, we are positive that Antonio Conte’s men are going to leave their hearts on the field. 

The former Chelsea and Juve boss is doing a great job with the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza outfit and given the Neroverdi’s shaky defence, away win should be considered. Sassuolo experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Atalanta and we do not believe that the bottom-table side are capable of grabbing something from Sunday’s football match. You should bear in mind, though, that Inter failed to beat Sassuolo in previous five meetings between the two clubs in the Italian top flight.",P,2019-2020

The Sardinians made a promising start to the season, but head coach Rolando Maran must warn his men against complacency as SPAL proved their worth in a hard-fought 1-0 win over Parma. The visitors, though, will be without suspended midfielder Espeto in Sunday’s football match and that is one of the main reasons why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. 

The Biancazzurri are not regarded as good travelers and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Cagliari’s party at Sardegna Arena. In their last meeting in Sardinia Cagliari recorded a 2-1 win over SPAL and you should bear in mind that the Biancazzurri have never defeated the Rossoblu on the road in the Italian elite division.",V,2019-2020

La Samp aim to put an end to their three-game losing run in the Serie A and we are positive that they are going to adopt an attack-minded approach in the football match against the Giallorossi. 

The Romans, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Cagliari at their Stadio Olimpico on Matchday 8, meaning that they are determined to get back on course in the Italian top flight as well. However, considering that key attacker Edin Dzeko could miss the game with injury, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on the capital club.

Udinese suffered a 1-0 loss to Fiorentina at Stadio Artemio Franchi, whereas Torino played out a goalless draw with Napoli in front of home fans. Both sides are eager to give fans something to cheer about this weekend and an entertaining game is on the cards in Udine. 

The Zebrette are tough to beat at home and the fact that they defeated Bologna 1-0 in their last home game in the Italian top flight is surely giving fans a reason for optimims ahead of the visit of Torino. However, Il Toro produced a fine displays in the draw with the Neapolitans and that is probably the main reason why we predict that they are going to grab something from the Dacia Arena clash.

The Gli Emiliani are stuck in the middle of the Serie A standings, but a win over the Rossoblu could see them climb to the top half of the table. Genoa continue with their habit of producing much better showings in at home than on the travels. 

The Rossoblu experienced all sorts of problems at the back in back-to-back away defeats to Cagliari (1-3) and Lazio (0-4) and we do not believe that they are capable of grabbing something from Sunday’s football game against Parma.

New coach Stefano Pioli is eager to help Milan footballers regain a much-needed confidence and seeing that they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course in the Serie A, home win should be considered. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, head into Sunday’s football match following back-to-back defeats to the likes of Roma and Atalanta and given the importance of the game for the hosts, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed from the trip to Milano. In their last meeting at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza (2012) Milan recorded a 2-0 win over Lecce, with the likes of Nocerino and Ibrahimovic scoring for the Bianconeri.

The Delfini are eyeing their third win of the season and their first home triumph of the process. The newcomers are likely to leave their hearts on the field, but beating in-form Fiorentina is easier said than done. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be controversial attacker Mario Balotelli, who has netted one goal in the Italian top flight so far this term. 

The Viola have been showing signs of improvement of late and the visitors will be looking to extend their winning run to four games in the Serie A when they face Brescia at Stadio Mario Rigamonti.

The Mastini aim to move away from the danger zone in the Serie A standings and given Sassuolo’s shaky defence, we believe that home win should be considered. 

The Neroverdi experienced all sorts of problems at the back in back-to-back defeats to the likes of Atalanta (1-4) and Inter (3-4) and given their poor away record in the Italian top flight, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the home side. In their last meeting in the “City of Love” Sassuolo recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Hellas Verona, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge.",V,2019-2020

Lecce suffered a loss in each of their first three home games of the season, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the Bianconeri. 

Maurizio Sarri’s troops are on a five-game winning run in the Italian top flight and seeing that Inter are breathing down their neck, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the title holders. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a beautiful goal in a 2-1 win over Bologna and we predict that he is going to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. ",P,2019-2020

Romelu Lukaku, who scored a brace in the 4-3 victory over Sassuolo, will be the man to watch in the away team and we predict that he is going to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The Gli Emiliani have been impressive in front of home fans of late, but despite crushing Genoa 5-1 at their Stadio Ennio Tardini, we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Inter’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.

The Rossoblu are on a three-game losing run in the Italian top flight, with the team conceding 11 goals in total in previous three league fixtures. The situation in their dressing room is alarming ahead of the visit of Brescia and we predict that the hosts are going to leave their hearts on the field in the relegation six-pointer. 

The Delfini, on the other hand, have been struggling to find their best form at the start of the season, but it seems as if their performances are better than their results.

The Rossoblu’s performances are undisputedly better than their results and it is no wonder they are seen as favourites to win Sunday’s football match against rock-bottom Sampdoria. One of the men to watch in the home team will be Argentine attacker Rodrigo Palacio, who scored a wonder goal in the 2-1 loss to Maurizio Sarri’s troops. 

La Samp, on the other hand, have collected only 4 points from possible 23 in the 2019/2020 Serie A season and seeing that they failed to find the net in previous two league fixtures, we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Bologna’s party at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara.

The Zebrette are not regarded as good travelers and seeing that they failed to find the net in previous three away games in the Italian top flight, we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Atalanta’s party at Gewiss Stadium. In each of their last three meetings in the Serie A the Orobici emerged triumphant and we do not believe that the Zebrette are capable of putting an end to the negative trend.

Carlo Ancelotti’s men have been impressive at the back of late, keeping a clean sheet in previous two league fixtures, and they are likely to rely on their rock-solid defence against SPAL. 

The hosts sit in the relegation zone in the Serie A table ahead of Matchday 9 and seeing that they failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Cagliari in Sardinia at the weekend, we do not believe that they are capable of matching the title-chasing side.

Torino are a real force to be reckoned with at home and seeing that they want this win more than the Sardinians, who sit in the fifth position in the standings, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Walter Mazzarri’s troops. Cagliari did well to beat Napoli at Stadio San Paolo earlier this term, but it has to be noted that Carlo Ancelotti’s troops missed a number of clear-cut opportunities to score in the 1-0 loss to the Rossoblu.

The Bosnia international is likely to return to the starting XI against Milan, but the hosts will be without pacey winger Justin Kluivert, who was sent off in the goalless draw with La Samp. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 2-2 draw with Lecce, meaning that new head coach Stefano Pioli will be looking to record his first win on his new job when Milan face Roma in the “Eternal City”.

Fiorentina have been in a fine form in the Italian top flight of late and they are definitely capable of matching the capital club in front of home fans. Federico Chiesa avoided serious injury while on international duty with Italy, meaning that he will be the man to watch in the home team. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, have been scoring goals for fun in the Serie A in recent weeks, with the team netting 9 goals in total in previous three league fixtures. Given Fiorentina’s attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

Hellas Verona, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 1-0 home loss to Sassuolo and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Parma’s party at Stadio Ennio Tardini.

The Viola quickly bounced back from a 2-1 defeat to Lazio, but they will be without Franck Ribery, and Martin Caceres against Parma as the duo is out of contention through suspension. In Ribery’s absence, a man to watch in the home team will be Federico Chiesa, who is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

Roberto D’Aversa’s troops failed to impress in a 1-0 home defeat to Hellas Verona, and given their poor away record in the Serie A; we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

New Milan boss Stefano Pioli is on a quest to bring glory days back to “Stadio San Siro,” and we are positive that the hosts will adopt an attack-minded approach against Lazio. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Poland international Krzystof Piatek, who has netted three goals in the Serie A so far this season. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, outclassed Torino 4-0 at home in their last league fixture, but beating Milan on the road is easier said than done. Given the importance of Sunday’s clash for the hosts, we predict that the two teams are going to share the spoils on Matchday 11. Lazio attacker Ciro Immobile, who scored a brace in the 4-0 win over Torino, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line. ",N,2019-2020

La Samp, who are eyeing their only second win of the season, just can’t find their form, but they will surely leave their hearts on the field in Monday’s relegation six-pointer. 

Anyhow, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on Claudio Ranieri’s men as they are not regarded as good travelers. SPAL, on the other hand, are tough to beat at home, with the team suffering only one loss in last three games at their Stadio Paolo Mazza. A close encounter is on the cards, and we believe that the two teams are going to share the spoils in Ferrara. In their last meeting in the Serie A, Sampdoria defeated SPAL 2-1.",N,2019-2020

Historically, Bologna edge this fixture, winning five of the previous 11 matches between them to the away side's 3. Additionally, Bologna havn't lost against in their last seven meetings. Both teams are struggling to get a foothold and will fancy their chances against each other. We believe Sassuolo's unimpressive home form, coupled with Bologna's inability to perform away from home, will generate a drab draw.

The away team meanwhile, is coming off of a respectable 1-0 loss to champions Juventus and will look to build on that performance. 

Not much is inferred from this fixture's history that includes just two games played, one a home victory for Brescia while the other one a 0-0 draw. Brescia's woeful home record this season calls for a swift improvement while Torino, after their home showing against Juve, are naturally the team with more confidence. Overall, both sides have been mediocre and will fancy their chances against an equally weak opponent. We believe that Torino edge this game.",P,2019-2020

The home team meanwhile, dominates the head to head, winning seven of the previous nine meetings between the two. 

Verona, at the same time, remained winless. With 30 goals generated in nine games, this fixture has proven to be a high scoring fixture. Inter has only lost once this season. They also have the coveted home advantage and possess a better squad than their opponents. We believe they are the favorites to win this game. Verona, meanwhile, is not to be taken lightly.

Off of a disappointing 2-1 loss to rivals Roma, the home side will look to go back to winning ways as they face a Genoa side that has won just once in seven attempts. The away side additionally, comes into this game having conceded more goals than any other team in the league. 

Historically, Napoli have dominated the fixture, winning 14 of the last 19 meetings to Genoa's one. The head to head stats shows that this fixture has recently generated fewer goals but traditionally is a high scoring game. Barring a 1-0 loss to Cagliari early on in the league, Napoli have been steady at home and will fancy their chances against an opponent low on both confidence and quality.

The home side who oversaw a solid 2-0 away victory in their last outing, comes into this game carrying an unbeaten streak of five games. Fiorentina meanwhile have lost just once away from home this season, and that occurred in early September. 

Historically, Fiorentina have had the better of the exchanges, winning seven of the 16 meetings to Cagliari's five. However, recent history shows that with two wins and a draw, it is the home side who are unbeaten in the last three meetings between the clubs. Statistics and current form both are in favor of the Cagliari, who additionally also has the home advantage at their side. However, Fiorentina have shown character away from home this season and comfortably have better players.

Not much can be inferred from the head to head fixture results between the two where-in of the four games have played Lazio have won two while Lecce have won one. These games, however, have generated a whopping 16 goals on an average of 4 goals per game. Lazio are outright favorites to win this game. They are unbeaten and look unbeatable when playing at home.

On the other hand, the away side has been having ups and downs so far and has established itself as the unpredictable team of the season. They have, however, scored more goals (30) than any other team in the league this season. Contrary to current situations, recent head to head fixtures between the two showcase Sampdoria's superiority. 

The Blucerchiati have won eight of the last fifteen meetings between the two. Atlanta meanwhile, has won five of those fixtures. With just one victory this season, Sampdoria have had a woeful league campaign and are desperate for a positive result. Atlanta have that air of unpredictability around them, but they are proven goal generators. We believe the home side's poor form continues against an inconsistent but potent Atlanta side who, in turn, will fancy their chances and look to tighten their grip on the European sport they occupy.

In recent history, this fixture has been played five times and generated 12 goals at an average of 2.4 goals per game. SPAL edge the head to head, winning two of the five games to Udinese's one. The Zebrette has been anything but consistent this season, but their 3-1 victory over Genoa last week, should give them enough motivation to go and win this game at home. SPAL have not won an away game this season, and we believe that this will continue against an opposition stronger than them in both quality and mentality. ",V,2019-2020

The home side meanwhile has been average at best this season. 

Having won just once in their last five, the Crociati come into this game in poor form. In terms of head to head, the Giallorossi have won the last two meetings between the clubs, scoring four goals in the process.

In terms of head to head results, the fixture has been played 29 times in recent history and has been primarily dominated by Juventus. The Old Lady has won 20 while Milan has won five of those fixtures. Juventus have additionally won the last eight meetings between the clubs. There is no doubt an enormous gulf of quality between old tow horses of the league. Nonetheless, this game continues to demand significance and retains it the stature of one of the more popular games of the season. Based on current league form and squad quality, Juventus are outright favorites.

The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to put an end to their three-game winless run in the Italian top flight. Atalanta failed to find the net in the previous two league fixtures, and seeing that Josip Ilicic is out of contention through suspension, we are tempted to put our money on the title holders.

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, have been struggling to live up to their expectations, with the team collecting only 19 points from possible 36.

A man to watch in the home team will be Andrea Belotti, who has netted seven goals in the Italian top flight so far this season. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, are still in the race for Scudetto. Antonio Conte is doing a great job with the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza outfit, with his team collecting 31 points from possible 36.

A man to keep an eye on in the home side will be experienced attacker Rodrigo Palacio, who has netted three goals so far this term. However, you should bear in mind that the hosts will be without Bani (suspension), Danilo (suspension), Destro (injury), and Dijks (injury) against Parma.

Even though Paulo Fonseca can’t count on the likes of Zappacosta, Kalinic, and Cristante for the Brescia game, home win should be considered as Roma have turned their Stadio Olimpico into a real fortress. A man to watch in the home team will be Bosnia international Edin Dzeko, while Roma defenders should have Mario Balotelli at bay.

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, aim to retain their spot in the top four, but Inter are likely to pose a much bigger threat for the capital club than their previous rivals. Inter are eyeing their third consecutive win at home in the Italian top flight, and we predict that they are going to give fans yet another reason for celebration.",V,2019-2020
140,2019-12-07,Atalanta,Hellas Verona,"Atalanta quickly bounced back from a 3-1 loss to Juventus, with the team rolling over Brescia 3-0 at Stadio Mario Rigamonti in their last league fixture. The Orobici sit in the sixth position in the Serie A standings ahead of Matchday 15, and, no doubt, playing on three fronts seems to be the team’s biggest problem in the 2019/2020 season. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Slovenia international Josip Ilicic, who scored his 5th goal of the season in the 3-0 triumph over Brescia. 

Hellas Verona, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Roma, but grabbing something from the Atalanta game is easier said than done. Over the years, the Orobici have turned their stadium into a real fortress; therefore, we are tempted to put our money on Gian Piero Gasperini’s troops, who are eyeing a place in the Champions League.",V,2019-2020

The Zebrette have been struggling to find their best form in the first half of the season, but they are surely capable of making life difficult for the out-of-sorts Partenopei. Udinese failed to find the net in the last two home games in the national championship, but given Napoli’s shaky defence, we predict that the hosts are going to find the net in Saturday’s football match. 

The Neapolitans suffered a shocking 2-1 loss to Bologna at their Stadio San Paolo at the weekend, meaning that they are low on confidence ahead of the trip to Udine. Since Carlo Ancelotti’s men do not seem to be on top of their game at the moment, we predict that the hosts are going to grab something from the match.",N,2019-2020

The Bianconeri recorded a routine 3-0 win over Udinese at the weekend, with Ciro Immobile extending his goal-scoring run in the Italian top flight. The experienced attacker, who has already netted 17 goals in the new Serie A season, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 2-2 draw with Sassuolo. Juve are eager to regain top position in the standings, but given Lazio’s impressive home record, we are tempted to put our money on draw. Cristiano Ronaldo scored from the penalty spot in the 2-2 draw with the Neroverdi, but the Portuguese attacker has not been at his sharpest in the first half of the season.",N,2019-2020

Lecce are high on spirits following a hard-fought 1-0 win at Fiorentina, and they are surely capable of beating the Rossoblu, who made a slow start to the season. 

Genoa have been struggling in front of goal of late, with the team failing to find the net in two of their last three league fixtures. The visitors are on a five-game winless run in the Italian top flight, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Lecce’s party at Stadio Comunale Via del Mare.

You should bear in mind that Sassuolo are after their fourth home win of the season. 

A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be experienced attacker Francesco Caputo, who scored his 7th goal of the season in the 2-2 draw with the Bianconeri. The Sardinians, on the other hand, have been scoring goals for fun in the first half of the season. Cagliari aim to regain their spot in top four, but beating Sassuolo at MAPEI Stadium – Citta del Tricolore is easier said than done.

SPAL play host to Brescia at their Stadio Paolo Mazza on Sunday afternoon, with the team eyeing their fourth home win of the season. 

Le Rondinelle, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level. The newcomers have collected only seven points from possible 39, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling SPAL’s party in Ferrara.

Walter Mazzarri’s troops failed to find the net in three of their last four home games in the Italian top flight, but we are positive that the hosts will put an end to the negative trend this weekend as they regained a much-needed confidence. 

The Viola, on the other hand, have been having their ups and downs in the first half of the season, and, as a result, they occupy 12th position in the Serie A table.

In their last home game in the Italian top flight, Claudio Ranieri’s men defeated Udinese 2-1, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of the visit of Parma. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Milan, and, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from the Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris. Anyhow, since the hosts want this win more than the visitors, we believe that punters can find value in betting on La Samp. Experienced attacker Fabio Quagaliarella has been struggling to find his goal-scoring touch in the first half of the season, but the opposition defenders should have him at bay.",V,2019-2020

Theo Hernandez’s goal helped the Rossoneri pick up all three points from the match and regain a much-needed confidence. New manager Stefano Pioli, though, is hungry for more success, and we are positive that Milan will go for a win in Sunday’s clash against Bologna. 

However, this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the visitors as the Rossoblu defeated Napoli at Stadio San Paolo at the weekend. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men, who aim to escape the danger zone in the Serie A standings, are surely capable of matching the Rossoneri at their Stadio Renato Dall’Ara.

Seeign that Brescia are eager to escape the relegation zone in the Serie A standings, we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at the Giallorossi, whose top flight status is in great danger as well. 

Lecce shared the spoils with Genoa at the weekend, with the team coming from two goals behind to grab something from the match.

Parma are level on points with Napoli ahead of Saturday’s football match, but the hosts want this win more than the visitors. The Gli Emiliani were hammered by Napoli in each of their last two meetings in the national championship, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered.

The Rossoblu will be without suspended duo Agudelo – Pandev against Sampdoria, meaning that home win should not be considered. 

La Samp, on the other hand, aim to put an end to their three-game losing run in all competitions. The nominal visitors are eager to escape the danger zone in the Serie A table, and they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course.

To make things even better for the Mastini, important centre-back Pawel Davidowicz was sent off in the dying minutes of the match. As a result, the 24-year-old defender misses the Torino game through suspension, but we predict that the hosts are capable of grabbing something from Sunday’s clash. 

Hellas Verona recorded two wins in the last three home games in the Serie A, which is certainly giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of the visit of Il Toro. The visitors, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Genoa and Fiorentina.

Milan have been showing signs of improvement ever since the new boss took over the reins, but they need to keep on raising their form if they are to represent Italy in the Champions League next season. 

Anyhow, we predict that the hosts are going to adopt an attack-minded approach in Sunday’s football game against Sassuolo.

The Orobici, on the other hand, scored a late winner against Hellas Verona to move a little closer to the Champions League berth. Since Atalanta will be fully focused on the national championship in days to come, we are positive that they will keep on climbing the standings.

Juve suffered a heart-breaking 3-1 loss to Lazio at Stadio Olimpico in their last league fixture, with the team once again showing weakness at the back. 

The title holders have been struggling to live up to their expectations under Maurizio Sarri, but home win should be considered as Udinese suit them. The Zebrette are on a four-game winless run in the Italian top flight, with the team sitting in the danger zone in the Serie A standings ahead of the trip to Turin.

The Romans are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and you should know that they are after their fourth consecutive triumph at their Stadio Olimpico. 

Speaking of the away team, the Gli Spallini suffered a heart-breaking 1-0 loss to Brescia in the relegation six-pointer, with the team extending their winless run in the league to eight games.

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, failed to extend their winning run in the Italian top flight, with the team sharing the spoils with Roma in front of home fans. 

Antonio Conte is doing a great job with the Stadio Giueseppe Meazza outfit, who are eager to put an end to Juventus’ dominance in the Italian elite division. Inter aim to take advantage of the fact that Fiorentina suffered a dip in form; therefore; away win should be considered. ",P,2019-2020

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, came from behind to beat title holders Juventus (3-1) at their Stadio Olimpico, with the team rejoining the race for Scudetto. Given Lazio’s attacking potential, we predict that both teams are going to find the net in the Sardegna Arena clash.

The Viola will want to finish the game on a high, as they have been in poor shape recently. Vincenzo Montella has been under pressure to deliver against Inter after 4 straight defeats in the Serie A. It looked like they were heading for the 5th defeat until the 90th minute when Vlahović scored the equalizer to make it 1-1. 

Montella’s men have played decently, but the lack of lethality upfront has cost them massively. Roma have enjoyed a good spell of form. The club from the Eternal city sits quite comfortably in the 4th spot, a place which takes them to Champions League next season. Fonseca has managed to reach expectations despite some aging players. It has been the young players – Zaniolo, Pellegrini and Kluivert that have been the staple of this team. This is bound to be a tight game.",N,2019-2020

At least to some people, but other people knew that this team has some quality players – Nainggolan, Joao Pedro, Marko Rog and Giovanni Simeone have been instrumental to Cagliari’s success. 

They are unbeaten in their last 13 league games – an exceptional achievement for a team with such a small budget. Udinese are heading for another relegation battle this season. Last season they were uncertain until the last game, and it looks to be the same this season. The Friulani come into this game after a 3-1 loss against Juventus. Their league form has been pretty poor – 3 losses and 2 draws the outcome of their last 5 games. At home, they have been quite good, and we can see a draw as the outcome here.",N,2019-2020

Antonio Conte has revived Inter this season. Their ambitious owner strengthened their ranks in the summer with Lukaku, Barella, and Sensi. It has paid off, as the team from Milano is now challenging for the title.

Conte’s high-energy 352 has worked wonders. Their last two games have resulted in draws, but they will be expecting a win against Genoa to keep up with Juventus. Genoa have disappointed their fans this season, especially after their 1-0 loss against bitter rivals Sampdoria in their last game. They seem to be heading for relegation, with only 11 points collected so far. Thiago Motta has had a moderate impact since coming to the bench in October, but Genoa still seems like a side with not enough quality for Serie A.

Torino have since won 3 games, drawn 2, and only lost 1 to Inter. 

Belotti is firing again, while the likes of Baselli, Zaza, and Berenguer have been essential for Mazzari. They will play SPAL, who look like the primary candidates for relegation this season. Their form, especially away from home, has been abysmal. They have only collected 9 points and only picked up a single point on the road.

Only one team has managed to do so, and it is Atalanta. The Azzurri currently sit 6th, but their qualification from their Champions League group has been their most impressive feat. 

They lost their last league game against Bologna, but many key players were absent. For the Milan game, both Zapata and Gomez are expected back, but Iličić is still questionable for this game. Milan, on the other hand, have been very disappointing. Last season it looked like they could qualify for Champions League, but this season they have been well off the pace. Their form has improved slightly recently, but they still look poor. It could be a tight game with both scoring, but we see the home team prevail.",V,2019-2020

They lost their last game against Brescia 3-0 but managed to beat Fiorentina away from home two games ago. 

At home, they have seen plenty of goals this season, and we can expect the trend to continue here. Bologna are a team with a lot of attacking potential, but a very liable defense. Their away games have produced goals from both sides on all but two occasions. Orsolini, Sansone and Palacio compose a deadly attack, but their defense is not the best. Their away form has been poor, but Lecce are a beatable team. We can see a high-scoring draw here in a game that could go either way.",N,2019-2020

Parma have an outside chance of Europa League qualification this season. They sit in the 7th spot prior to their game with Brescia, with two straight wins against Napoli and Sampdoria on their account. In fact, they only lost to Milan in their last five games. 

They will undoubtedly be looking for a win against a poor Brescia side, but it won’t be easy. This is because Brescia have seen an upturn in their fortunes recently. Some bizarre things have been happening at the club, which is not surprising for Cellino, who is known as a trigger-happy owner. Eugenio Corini was sacked in November but has been reinstalled as the manager on the 2nd of December. Since then, Le Rondinelle have won two consecutive games against Lecce and SPAL.

Simone Inzaghi’s troops, on the other hand, are likely to stick to their attacking style of play; therefore, we believe that punters can find value in backing on both teams to score.

Sassuolo are a team with a lot of attacking potential. Their games have seen the second-highest amount of goals, only behind Atalanta. Their attacking players have been deadly – Boga, Berardi and Caputo. Defensively, the Neroverdi are very liable for conceding goals. 

They have kept only one clean sheet at home this season, but have also scored in every single game. We can see this trend continue here. They will play Napoli, who are in a bad place at the moment. Some strange things have been happening at the club when Ancelotti had to leave the club due to disagreements with the owner. Genaro Gattuso has taken over, and it has not been best-received by the fans and the players alike. This was only confirmed by their 1-2 home loss against Parma.

Even though SPAL will be without Reca, Sala, D’alessandro, and Fares (all injured) against Hellas Verona, we predict that they are going to find the net in Sunday’s clash.

The Romans aim to build on back-to-back wins over SPAL and Fiorentina, and a victory over Torino could see them overtake their bitter local rivals Lazio in the Serie A standings. The likes of Santon, Cristante, and Zappacosta are sidelined with injury for the hosts, but Paulo Fonseca has a number of top-class players to choose from. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 2-1 home defeat to SPAL, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the Giallorossi. Experienced attacker Edin Dzeko, who has netted seven goals in the Italian top flight so far this term, is widely expected to lead the line for the home team. ",V,2019-2020
174,2020-01-06,Bologna,Fiorentina,"Bologna have been in a fine form in the Serie A of late. Following a 2-1 win over Atalanta, the Rossoblu did well to beat Lecce 3-2 in their last league fixture. Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is battling serious illness, and his men are brimming with confidence ahead of the visit of Fiorentina, but they will have to prove their worth on the field. Dijks and Krejci are sidelined with injury, while Dzemaili is rated doubtful for the Fiorentina clash. 

The Viola, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Roma. The visitors are having yet another season to forget, and given their current form, we believe that home win should be considered. Experienced winger Franck Ribery is sidelined with injury, while Marco Benassi should be assessed ahead of the Stadio Renato Dall’Ara showdown. ",V,2019-2020

The Rossoneri are low on spirits ahead of the first game of the new year, but they are still considered favourites to pick up all three points from Monday’s clash. Milan failed to win the previous three home games in the Italian top flight, but it has to be noted that they faced a tough fixture list. 

Sampdoria, on the other hand, have been struggling in the first half of the season, with the team collecting only 15 points from possible 51. La Samp are not regarded as good travellers, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Milan’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. You should bear in mind that the Rossoneri boss Stefano Pioli has a full squad to choose from.",V,2019-2020
176,2020-01-06,Atalanta,Parma,"Buoyed by a splendid 5-0 win over Italian giants Milan, Atalanta will be looking to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they welcome Parma at their Gewiss Stadium. The Orobici are eyeing a place in the Champions League, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Roberto D’Aversa’s troops on Matchday 18. Duvan Zapata is rated doubtful for the Parma game, but the likes of Josip and Papu Gomez are going to make life difficult for the opposition defenders. 

Despite the fact that the Gli Emiliani occupy seventh position in the table, home win should be considered as Atalanta are a real force to be reckoned with at home. It has to be noted that the Orobici are eyeing their third consecutive win over the Gli Emiliani in the Italian elite division. A man to watch in the away team will be former Roma winger Gervinho.",V,2019-2020

The Bianconeri quickly bounced back from a 3-1 loss to Lazio, with the team beating the likes of Udinese and Sampdoria in the previous two league fixtures. Juve boss Maurizio Sarri is likely to field the best possible side against Cagliari, and despite the Rossoblu’s fine form in the first half of the season, home win should be considered. 

A man to watch in the home team will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored his tenth goal of the season in the triumph over La Samp. The Sardinians, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team losing to the likes of Lazio and Udinese in the previous two league fixtures. Given Juve’s impressive home record in the Serie A, the visitors are likely to return to Sardinia empty-handed.",V,2019-2020

The newcomers are on a three-game winless run in the Italian top flight, but it seems as if their performances are better than their results. 

Considering that the Giallorossi have been scoring goals for fun at home ground of late, we are positive that they are going to find the net in Monday’s clash. The Zebrette, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-1 win over Cagliari. Udinese are not regarded as good travellers, but given their current form, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

The Neapolitans have been struggling to live up to their expectations in the first half of the season, but they gave fans some cheer in their last league match. New boss Genaro Gattuso recorded his first win with Napoli against Sassuolo, and, no doubt, this triumph gave the team a confidence boost.

The Partenopei are eager to secure a top-four finish, meaning that Monday’s showdown is of big importance for them. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to retain top position in the Serie A standings. Considering that Napoli are without key defender Koulibaly, both teams to score betting option should be considered. You should bear in mind that in their last meeting in the Italian elite division Napoli recorded a 4-1 win over Inter. ",N,2019-2020

The Rossoblu aim to get back on course in the Italian top flight, and they are surely capable of making life difficult for the Rossoneri, who failed to impress in a goalless draw with Sampdoria. 

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is likely to start for Stefano Pioli’s team against Cagliari, but we do not believe that the experienced attacker is going to help the Stadio San Siro outfit improve their game. Considering that the Sardinians are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. ",V,2019-2020
181,2020-01-11,Lazio,Napoli,"Lazio and Napoli take on each other in a highly-anticipated clash at Stadio Olimpico. The Biancocelesti recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over Brescia at the weekend, with the team extending their winning run in the Serie A to nine games. Lazio aim to stay in the race for the trophy; therefore, we are positive that they will stick to their attacking style of play against Napoli. The Partenopei are having a season to forget. 

Genaro Gattuso’s team have already dropped a number of points in the 2019/2020 season, and given Lazio’s current form, we predict that the visitors are going to return to Naples empty-handed. Ciro Immobile, who scored a brace in the 2-1 win over Brescia, will be the man to watch in the home team. You should bear in mind that Lazio are after their first win over Napoli since May 2015.",V,2019-2020
182,2020-01-11,Inter,Atalanta,"There will be fireworks when Inter and Atalanta face each other at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in the Serie A derby. Atalanta’s recent performances are terrific, with the team netting ten goals in total in back-to-back wins over Milan and Parma. The Orobici aim to retain their spot in the top four in the Serie A table, but beating Inter in Milano is easier said than done.

 Anyhow, given Atalanta’s attacking potential, we predict that the visitors are going to find the net in the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza clash. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to put an end to Juventus’ dominance in the Italian top flight. Antonio Conte is doing a great job with Inter, who are a real force to be reckoned with at home. Seeing that the attacking partnership of Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez has been in a perfect working order this term, both teams to score bet should be considered.",N,2019-2020
183,2020-01-12,Udinese,Sassuolo,"Udinese and Sassuolo, the two teams who sit in the middle of the Serie A table, face each other at Dacia Arena in what is expected to be a close encounter. The Zebrette continue with their habit of producing much better displays at home than on the travels, and it has to be noted that they are undefeated in the previous four home games in all competitions. Udinese aim to climb to the top half of the standings, but the game against the Neroverdi will be anything but a walk in the park for the home side. 

Sassuolo aim to make amends for back-to-back losses, but they should be happy with one point from the Dacia Arena showdown. The two teams seem to be evenly matched ahead of Matchday 19; therefore, we are tempted to put our money on draw. N their last meeting in the Serie A the two teams played out a 1-1 draw.",N,2019-2020

The Viola extended their winless run in the Serie A to eight games, meaning that the hosts are low on spirits ahead of the visit of SPAL. However, they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways in the Italian top flight. 

SPAL sit in the last position in the Serie A table after 18 rounds, with the team recording only one victory in the last eleven games. Leonardo Semplici’s troops do not seem to be competitive at this level, and given Fiorentina’s performance in the 1-1 draw with Bologna, home win should be considered.

La Samp are not having a season to remember, but the game against the fellow relegation-threatened team could be the turning point for the hosts. 

You should bear in mind, though, that attacker Gaston Ramirez is likely to miss the game with injury. In his absence, all eyes will be on experienced striker Fabio Quagliarella. Brescia, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss to Lazio in their last league match, with defender Andrea Cistana being sent off. Since Mario Balotelli and Co. have been struggling to find their form in the Italian elite division of late, home win should be considered.",V,2019-2020

Torino fans could not have wished for a better start to 2020, but their favourites should not stop now. 

Considering that the hosts will adopt an attack-minded approach against Bologna, we predict that they are going to find the net in Sunday’s football game. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, showed character in their last league match, with the team sharing the spoils with Fiorentina thanks to Riccardo Orsolini’s goal in the dying minutes of the game.

The Mastini are placed in the top part of the table, with the Rossoblu sitting in the relegation zone. Hellas Verona aim to build on a 2-0 win over SPAL, and we are positive that they will adopt yet another attack-minded approach against Genoa. 

Considering that the Mastini have been scoring goals for fun in the Serie A of late, home win should be considered. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are not having a season to remember. Genoa have been struggling on the travels in the 2019/2020 season, and given Verona’s fine form, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed.

The Giallorossi must be low on confidence ahead of the visit of the Bianconeri; therefore, home win should not be considered. 

The reigning champions, on the other hand, rolled over Cagliari 4-0 on Monday afternoon, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick. Juve are after their fourth consecutive win in the Italian top flight, and we predict that they are going to give fans yet another reason for celebration.

Parma aim to bounce back from a heavy 5-0 loss to Atalanta, and they are surely capable of making life difficult for Lecce in front of home fans. The Gli Emiliani aim to retain their spot in the top half of the Serie A standings, but home win should not be considered as pacey winger Gervinho is sidelined with injury. 

Lecce, on the other hand, are eager to secure the Serie A survival. The newcomers are fighting hard to avoid the drop to the Serie B, and we are positive that they are going to grab something from the Parma game. You should bear in mind that Lecce have already registered three wins on the road in the 2019/2020 Serie A season.

The Biancocelesti are enjoying a season to remember, but they need to keep on improving their game if they are to win the title for the first time since 2000. Ciro Immobile looks unstoppable at the moment, meaning that the opposition back-line should have him at bay. 

Sampdoria, on the other hand, produced their best performances of the season in a 5-1 win over Brescia, with Italy veteran Fabio Quagliarella scoring a brace. However, La Samp, who are not regarded as good travelers, will have a much bigger fish to fry against Lazio, who have turned their Stadio Olimpico into a real fortress.

The Neroverdi have been struggling to find their best form at the start of the year, and, as a result, their Serie A status is in danger. Since Sassuolo are only five points clear of the relegation zone, we predict that they are going to leave their hearts on the field in Saturday’s football match. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Roma and Bologna. Walter Mazzarri’s men are eyeing a place in European competitions, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters can find value in betting on both teams to score.

The Viola, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against SPAL, and they managed to get one.

The Rossoneri aim to move a little closer to the Champions League berth, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at the Zebrette. 

A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be aforementioned attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. Udinese have been in a splendid form of late, with the team recording a win in each of their previous three league fixtures.

The Sardinians, on the other hand, suffered a 2-0 loss to Cagliari in their last league match, with the team extending their losing run in the national championship to four games. 

The Rossoblu have been totally out of form of late, which should see Brescia pick up vital three points from Sunday’s showdown.

Lecce are desperate to secure the Serie A survival, while Inter are eyeing their first Scudetto since 2010. The Nerazzurri dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Atalanta at the weekend, meaning that head coach Antonio Conte is likely to field the best possible side against Lecce.

A man to watch in the away team will be Romelu Lukaku, who has netted 14 goals in the Italian top flight so far this season. The newcomers, on the other hand, do not seem to be on top of their game ahead of the visit of Inter.

The Rossoblu remained in the relegation zone, meaning that the lack of confidence could prove to be a big problem for Davide Nicola’s charges. 

The Romans, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form. Following a 2-0 loss to Torino, the Giallorossi were beaten by Juventus in their second consecutive home fixture.

Anyhow, Atalanta’s current form is amazing, and we predict that they are going to extend their winning run at home to four games. 

A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Slovenia international Josip Ilicic, who scored a brace in the triumph over Parma.

Aforementioned attacker Rebic, who scored a brace in the victory over the Zebrette, is likely to return to the starting XI against Brescia. 

Le Rondinelle are fighting hard to secure the Serie A survival, but that is easier said than done.

Lazio rolled over Sampdoria 5-1 in their last league match, with the team keeping their hopes of winning Scudetto alive. Ciro Immobile once again proved his worth, with the experienced attacker scoring a hat-trick against La Samp, and, no doubt, all eyes will be on him in the Rome derby. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, did well to beat Genoa 3-1 on the road, with the team retaining their spot in top four. Edin Dzeko scored his 8th goal of the season in the victory over the Rossoblu, meaning that the opposition defenders should have him at bay. The good news for Paulo Fonseca’s team is that important defender Aleksandar Kolarov returns from suspension.

The Bianconeri recorded a very important win over Parma in their last league match, with Cristiano Ronaldo adding two more goals to his account. CR7, who has found his goal-scoring touch of late, is likely to pose a big threat to the opposition defenders, and given Napoli’s current form, away win should be considered. 

The Neapolitans head into the match following a 2-0 home loss to Fiorentina, meaning that the lack of confidence could prove to be a big problem for Genaro Gattuso’s troops. Key defender Kalidou Koulibaly remains on the sidelines for the hosts, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on Juventus.

Bologna are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Brescia, but you should bear in mind that Tomiyasu (suspended), Medel (injury), and Denswil (injury) are all out of contention for the hosts. 

Brescia, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the Serie A standings, with the team failing to win the last six league fixtures.

Cagliari, though, have been showing signs of improvement of late, and we predict that they are going to pick up all three points from Saturday’s football game. The visitors did well to beat Udinese at home at the weekend, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry against the Sardinians.

Even though Zaniolo, Diawara, and Zappacosta are sidelined with injury, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors, who have been in a fine form of late.

Edin Dzeko, who found the net in the Rome derby, will be one of the men to watch in the away team.

A man to watch in the home team will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has netted 17 goals in 18 appearances in the Serie A this season.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic failed to find the net in the 1-0 win over Brescia, but the January signing is likely to prove a handful for Hellas Verona defenders on Matchday 22. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, recorded a 3-0 win over Lecce in their last league match to retain their spot in the top half of the table. Verona, though, will have a much bigger fish to fry against Milan, who have found their best form in 2020.

Atalanta are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Genoa, and given the Rossoblu’s current form, home win should be considered. 

Atalanta boss Gian Piero Gasperini has no fresh injury worries, and he is likely to field the best possible side against Genoa. The Rossoblu are fighting hard to avoid relegation to the Serie B and give their poor away record in the Italian top flight, we are positive that the Orobici are going to pick up all three points from Sunday’s clash.

You should bear in mind that Lazio are eyeing their seventh consecutive home win in the Italian top flight. 

Both Marusic and Correa are rated doubtful for the game, but top scorer Ciro Immobile will almost certainly lead the line for the hosts. SPAL, on the other hand, did well to shock Atalanta in Bergamo in their last away game, but they failed to impress in a 3-1 loss to Bologna at the weekend.

Sunday’s football match is of big importance for the relegation strugglers, and they should take advantage of the fact that Il Toro experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 7-0 loss to Atalanta. 

Seeing that the visitors will be suspended duo Izzo and Lukic against Lecce, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts, who are desperate to get back on course.

Antonio Conte’s men failed to win the previous three league fixtures, meaning that they are desperate to return to winning ways. 

Lautaro Martinez is sidelined through suspension, and, in his absence, summer signing and Chile international Alexis Sanchez is likely to start the match.

The Zebrette are on a five-game winless run in the Serie A ahead of the trip to Bologna, but we predict that they will take advantage of the current situation in the Bologna dressing room. Udinese’s performances are much better than their results, which is yet another reason why away win should be considered. When the two teams met at Dacia Arena in the first half of the season Udinese recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win Bologna, with Stefano Okaka Chuka scoring the only goal of the match. ",P,2019-2020
243,2020-02-22,SPAL,Juventus,"After suffering four consecutive wins in the Serie A, SPAL will be looking to get back on course when they take on league leaders Juventus on Saturday evening. The Biancazzurri have been struggling at the back of late, and it is no wonder they are stuck at the bottom of the table ahead of the visit of Juve. Since the hosts head into the match with the lack of confidence, they are unlikely to upset the Serie A giants. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-0 win over Brescia. Cristiano Ronaldo was rested in Sunday’s clash, but the team’s top scorer is likely to return to the starting XI against SPAL. Considering that both Lazio and Inter are breathing down Juve’s neck in the Serie A table, we believe that anything but a routine away win will be a major surprise. ",P,2019-2020
244,2020-02-22,Fiorentina,Milan,"Fiorentina will be looking to build on a thrilling 5-1 win at Sampdoria when they host Milan at their Stadio Artemio Franchi on Matchday 25. The Viola did well to put an end to their four-game winless run in all competitions, with the team regaining a much-needed confidence. A man to watch in the home team will be Federico Chiesa, who scored a brace in the triumph over la Samp. 

Even though Croatia international Milan Badelj is sidelined through suspension, we predict that the hosts are going to grab something from the match. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, aim to move a little closer to the Europa League berth, meaning that a lively contest is on the cards at Stadio Artemio Franchi. In the first half of the season Fiorentina defeated Milan 3-1 at Stadio San Siro, which is yet another reason why both teams to score bet should be considered.",N,2019-2020

The Rossoblu aim to build on back-to-back wins over Cagliari and Bologna, but they will have a big fish to fry against the title-chasing side. A man to watch in the home team will be Arnaldo Sanabria as Goran Pandev is sidelined with injury. The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, showed character in a 2-1 win over Inter, with the team coming from behind to beat the fellow title-chasing side at their Stadio Olimpico. 

Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who returned from suspension against Inter, will be one of the men to watch in the away team. Considering that Ciro Immobile has been scoring goals for fun in the Serie A this season, we predict that the capital club will extend their winning run to three games. When the two teams met in the “Eternal City” earlier this term Lazio rolled over Genoa 4-0.",P,2019-2020

The Orobici showed character in a come-from-behind win over Roma, and despite their tough fixture list, we believe that Gian Piero Gasperini’s troops are going to cement their spot in top four. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, suffered a 1-0 loss to Parma in front of home fans at the weekend, with the team dropping to 12th position in the standings. 

Even though Sassuolo defeated SPAL in their last away game in the national championship, we are tempted to put our money on Atalanta, who are eyeing a place in the Champions League. Mario Pasalic, who came from the bench to score the winner against Roma, is widely expected to replace Duvan Zapata in the starting line-up. ",V,2019-2020

Il Toro do not seem to be on top of their game ahead of Matchday 25, with the team defence looking pretty shaky. Parma, on the other hand, proved their worth in a hard-fought 1-0 win at Sassuolo, with the team keeping their Europa League hopes alive. 

Roberto D’Aversa’s charges aim to keep on beating the odds, and we predict that they are going to take advantage of the fact that Torino suffered a dip in form. Gervinho, who scored the winner against the Neroverdi, will be the man to watch in the away team. Parma are undefeated in the previous three meetings with Torino in the Serie A, which is yet another reason why away win should be considered.",P,2019-2020

The Mastini are eyeing their fourth consecutive win on home soil, and the fact that they defeated Juve in the “City of Love” is surely giving fans a reason for optimism. 

Ivan Juric is doing a great job with Hellas Verona, who are seen as favourites to win Sunday’s football match. The Sardinians, on the other hand, suffered back-to-back defeats to Genoa and Napoli in the previous two league fixtures. Even though key midfielder Radja Nainggolan returns from suspension, we are tempted to put our money on the Mastini as the Rossoblu have been struggling to find their best form in the second half of the season.",V,2019-2020

The Giallorossi suffered a dip in form in the Serie A, but they are still in the race for a place in the Champions League. The Romans have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Lecce, and we predict that they are going to give fans something to cheer about this time out. 

Edin Dzeko found the net in the 2-1 loss to the Orobici, meaning that the opposition defenders should have him at bay. Fabio Liverani’s men have been in a fine form of late, with the team winning each of their previous three league fixtures. However, home win should be considered as Roma in our opinion want this win more than Lecce.",V,2019-2020

Despite the defeat the Nerazzurri are still in the race for Scudetto, and they are likely to adopt an attack-minded approach in Sunday’s football game. Lautaro Martinez returns from suspension against Lazio, and he is likely to keep his place in the starting XI, alongside Romelu Lukaku. 

Sampdoria, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 5-1 loss to Sampdoria, and they are unlikely to spoil Inter’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. Important defender Nicola Murru misses the match through suspension, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on Antonio Conte’s troops.

The Biancocelesti did well to beat Genoa on the road in their last league match, with Ciro Immobile scoring his 27th goal of the match. The experienced attacker looks unstoppable at the moment, and we predict that he is going to lead Simone Inzaghi’s team to yet another victory. 

Seeing that Lazio are only one point behind league leaders Juventus in the Serie A standings, the game against Bologna is of big importance for the capital club. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, played out a 1-1 draw with Udinese in their last league fixture. Seeing that the likes of Mbaye (suspension), Dijks (injury), Krejci (injury), Svanberg (injury), Medel (injury), and Sansone (injury) are all out of contention, we do not believe that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are capable of spoiling Lazio’s party in Rome.

The Neapolitans are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and despite their tough fixture list, we predict that they are going to find the net against Torino. 

The good news for the hosts is that centre-back Koulibaly could recover in time to face Il Toro. The visitors, on the other hand, are on a five-game losing run in the Serie A ahead of the trip to Naples. Torino do not seem to be on top of their game at the moment, but given their attacking potential, both teams to score bet should be considered. ",N,2019-2020

The Giallorossi are only three points clear of the relegation zone, meaning that the game against the Orobici is of big importance for them. 

You should bear in mind, though, that the likes of Farias, Saponara, Babacar, and Falco are all out of contention through injury. The Orobici, on the other hand, are eyeing their third consecutive win in the national championship.

Edin Dzeko, who has found his goal-scoring touch of late, will be the man to watch in the away team, while Gianluca Mancini misses the match through suspension. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, were not in action at the weekend.

Parma aim to keep their Europa League hopes alive, and we predict that they will adopt an attack-minded approach in Sunday’s football match against the rock-bottom side. 

Even though the likes of Hernani, Scozzarella, Inglese, Sepe, Laurini, and Barilla miss the game with injury, we are tempted to put our money on Parma, who are a real force to be reckoned with at home.

Milan were not in action at the weekend due to fears of the spread of coronavirus, meaning that tired legs are unlikely to prove to be a big problem for Stefano Pioli’s troops.

A man to watch in the home team will be January signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has netted two goals ever since he returned to the club. Genoa, on the other hand, aim to escape the relegation zone, but we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Milan’s party at Stadio San Siro.

La Samp were not in action in the Serie A in the last two weekends, meaning that they have yet to recover from an embarrassing 5-1 home loss to Fiorentina. Since that both Murru and Ramirez miss the Verona match through suspension, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on the home side. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, suffered their last league defeat on December 7, 2019. The visitors must be high on confidence ahead of the trip to Genoa, and we predict that they are going to take advantage of the current situation in the Sampdoria dressing room.

Prodl remains in the recovery room, but De Maio and Sema are back to contention. 

The Viola, on the other hand, shared the spoils with Milan in their last league fixture. Dalbert Henrique, who was sent off in the draw with the Rossoneri, will have to serve his ban against Udinese, whereas Kouame and Ribery are out of contention through injury.

Juve are eager to retain top position in the standings, and we believe that they are going to take advantage of the fact that Inter’s current form is anything but brilliant. The Nerazzurri failed to impress in a 2-1 loss at Lazio, and seeing that Maurizio Sarri can count on key players for Sunday’s derby, home win should be considered.

Considering that the Neroverdi failed to impress in a 1-0 home loss to Parma, share of spoils is on the horizon. It has to be noted that Sassuolo boss Roberto de Zerbi has a full squad to choose from. As for the away team, defender Ales Mateju misses the game through suspension.

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Parma.

Fiorentina, on the other hand, picked up only one point from a 1-1 draw with Brescia. Seeing that experienced defender Martin Caceres misses the Lazio game through suspension, we do not believe that the visitors are capable of shocking the capital club at Stadio Olimpico.

The Gli Spallini, on the other hand, suffered a 1-0 loss to Cagliari in their first match after the coronavirus break. SPAL have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival, and given Napoli’s current form, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed.

Important defender Milan Skriniar is sidelined through suspension, while Marcelo Brozovic and Matias Vecino are both rated doubtful for the Parma game. 

The hosts, on the other hand, restarted the season in style, with the team rolling over Genoa on the road. Parma have been performing above expectations in the 2020/21 season, and, as a result, they are still in the race for a place in European competitions.

Sampdoria are seven points clear of the bottom three, meaning that they are on the right track to secure the Serie A survival. Anyhow, we are tempted to put our money on Atalanta as Sampdoria are not regarded as good travellers. The Orobici are eyeing their fifth consecutive win at home in the Italian top flight.

Even though midfielder Roberto Soriano misses the game through suspension, we predict that the hosts are going to find the net in Wednesday’s football match. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, have been scoring goals for fun in the Serie A of late, with the team netting 13 goals in total in the previous four league fixtures.

The Biancazzurri, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Hellas Verona, and they managed to get one. 

Brescia regained a much-needed confidence at the weekend, and, no doubt, they are capable of making life difficult for the out-of-sorts Il Toro.

SPAL have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival, but the hope dies last.

The Zebrette dropped a two-goal advantage in a draw with Genoa, with the team remaining in the danger zone. Udinese did well to beat Roma at Stadio Olimpico in their last away game, and seeing that there will be no spectators at Stadio Paolo Mazza, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors.

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Bologna. The Rossoblu ruined Inter’s title hopes, and seeing that Verona are tough to beat at home, we predict that the Mastini are going to grab something from the game.

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, are eyeing a place in the Europa League. The capital club came from behind to beat Parma on Matchday 31 to regain a much-needed confidence, but they do not want to stop now.

Parma boss Roberto D’Aversa has a full squad to choose from for the Bologna game. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-1 loss to Sassuolo in their last league fixture.

La Samp, on the other hand, produced a fine display against Atalanta in Bergamo, but the Orobici eventually managed to break the deadlock. Anyhow, the visitors have been showings signs of improvement of late, and they should take advantage of the fact that Sunday’s match will be played behind closed doors.

The Rossoneri came from behind to beat their bitter rivals Juventus 4-2 in the Serie A derby.

The Partenopei have already booked their place in the Europa League as they defeated Juventus in the Italian Cup final, but they surely want to finish the season in style. 

Given Napoli’s attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

The Rossoblu are on a four-game winless run in the Italian top flight, and given their shaky defence, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Atalanta.

Francesco Caputo, who has been scoring goals for fun of late, will be the man to keep an eye on in the home team. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, did well to crush Bologna 5-1 on Matchday 34, with the team moving one step closer to booking their place in the Europa League. Considering that Stefano Pioli’s men will go for a win as well, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

Genaro Gattuso’s men are eyeing a top-five finish, and we are positive that they will adopt an attack-minded approach against Parma. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2 loss to Sampdoria. Parma have little to play for in the season finale, and seeing that they are on a seven-game winless run in the Serie A, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors.

A win over Fiorentina will see Inter keep their Scudetto hopes alive, and we are positive that Antonio Conte’s troops are going to leave their hearts on the field. 

The Viola, on the other hand, proved their worth in back-to-back wins over Lecce and Torino. Fiorentina regained a much-needed confidence, but Inter are likely to pose a much bigger threat for them than their previous rivals.

The Delfini, on the other hand, recorded a Pyrrhic victory over SPAL at the weekend. Brescia have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Lecce’s party at Stadio Via del Mare.

La Samp have been scoring goals for fun of late, and you should bear in mind that over 2.5 goals have been netted in 12 of their last 13 league fixtures. 

Claudio Ranieri can count on key players for the Genoa clash. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, picked up vital three points in the relegation battle from the clash against Lecce.

The Romans, on the other hand, were on the verge of beating Inter at Stadio Olimpico, but the Nerazzurri eventually scored a late equalizer to save one point. Anyhow, Davis faces Goliath at Stadio Paolo Mazza, and anything but a routine away win would be a major surprise.

Juve, on the other hand, aim to move one step closer to winning Scudetto, and seeing that Udinese suit the Italian giants, away win should be considered. You should bear in mind that Juventus defeated Udinese in each of their previous six meetings in the Serie A.

Cagliari, on the other hand, came from behind to share the spoils with Sassuolo at the weekend.

The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to keep their Scudetto hopes alive, and given their attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

Lecce have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Bologna, and given the attacking potential of Sinisa Mihajlovic’s team, a lively contest is on the cards. 

The Rossoblu suffered a dip in form, but they are surely capable of matching the relegation strugglers on home soil.

The Neapolitans aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss to Inter, but home win should not be considered as they head into the match with the lack of motivation. Genaro Gattuso’s troops booked their place in the Europa League through the Coppa Italia, meaning that they have little to play for in the last match of the season. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, recorded a 2-0 win over Brescia in midweek, with the team extending their winning run in the Serie A to three games. Seeing that Atalanta and Inter go head to head in Bergamo this weekend, a win over Napoli will see Lazio secure a top-three finish. The visitors want this win more than the hosts, and that is the main reason why away win should be considered. ",P,2019-2020

The Viola are eager to secure a top-ten finish, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the rock-bottom side. Seeing that boss Giuseppe Iachini can count on key players for the last match of the season, away win should be considered. Spal, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-0 loss to Verona. 

Spal head coach Luigi di Biagio has a number of selection worries ahead of the visit of Fiorentina, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the visitors. Luigi di Biagio’s men have not been competitive in the Serie A this term, and it is no wonder they will compete in the Italian second tier next season.",P,2019-2020

The Rossoblu experienced all sorts of problems at the back in their last league match, but they are surely capable of matching Torino at home ground. Experienced attacker Rodrigo Palacio returns to contention after serving his ban against Fiorentina. Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 3-2 loss to Roma. Torino have been struggling to find their best form of late, and it is no wonder they are seen as underdogs in Sunday’s football game. Even though Tomas Rincon is back from suspension for the visitors, we are tempted to put our money on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops.

Seeing that a win over Verona will see Genoa secure the elite division survival, we are positive that Davide Nicola’s troops are going to leave their hearts on the field. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, head into the match following a routine 3-0 win over SPAL. Verona aim to overtake Sassuolo in the 8th position in the standings, but given the importance of the match for the relegation strugglers, the visitors are likely to return to the “City of Love” empty-handed.

Lecce are one point behind 17th-place Genoa in the Serie A standings, meaning that they face yet another must-win situation against Parma. Defender Andrea Rispoli returns to the starting XI after serving his ban against the Zebrette. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, have nothing to play for in Sunday’s football match as they are stuck in the middle of the standings. Lecce are eager to earn vital three points in the relegation battle, and we predict that they are going to prove their worth on the field.

The Zebrette, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss to relegation strugglers Lecce on Wednesday evening. 

Udinese have been having their ups and downs in the Serie A of late, but given Sassuolo’s display in the crushing of Genoa, we are tempted to put our money on Roberto de Zerbi’s troops. In the first half of the season Udinese outplayed Sassuolo 3-0 at Dacia Arena, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge.

Fiorentina chiefs did well to sign permanent deals with Alfred Duncan, Pol Lirola, Christian Kouame, and Giacomo Bonaventura in the summer, with a number of footballers returning to club from their loan spells. 

Torino, on the other hand, managed to tie pacey winger Simone Verdi, with the club chiefs keeping hold of Andrea Belotti. However, away win should not be considered as Il Toro are not regarded as good travellers.

Summer signing Adrien Tameze, on the other hand, is likely to make his Serie A debut against Roma. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, missed out on a place in the Champions League last term, with their bitter local rivals Lazio finishing fourth. The club chiefs did well to sign pacey winger Pedro from Chelsea, who is likely to pose a big threat for the opposition defenders.

Experienced attacker Gervinho is still part of the team, while midfielder Jasmin Kurtic misses the match through suspension. Napoli, on the other hand, did well to sign talented Nigeria attacker Victor Osimhen in the summer transfer window, who is likely to make his Serie A debut this weekend.

New boss Andrea Pirlo has a number of top-class players to choose from, who are likely to record a routine win in the season opener. 

As always, a man to watch in the home team will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored his 100th goal with the Portugal national team in the Nations League victory over Sweden.

The club chiefs did well to sign a couple of talented players in the summer transfer window, with the likes of Sandro Tonali (loan), Brahim Diaz, and Pierre Kalulu joining the famous Italian outfit. 

Mateo Musacchio misses the season opener with injury, while both Romagnoli and Rafael Leao are rated doubtful. The Rosoblu have been producing fine showings in the Italian top flight ever since Sinisa Mihajlovic took over the reins.

As before, Belgium superstar Romelu Lukaku is going to lead the line for the hosts.

Roberto De Zerbi is doing a great job with the Neroverdi, and we predict that they are going to prove their worth on the field.

413,2020-10-04,Milan,Spezia,"Milan and Spezia face each other in a David-vs-Goliath clash at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza on day 3 of the new Serie A campaign. The Rossoneri kicked off the new season in style, with the team beating both Bologna and Crotone by two goals to nil, but they do not want to stop now. Milan are on a quest to put an end to Juventus’ dominance in the Italian top flight, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at Spezia on Matchday 3. 

Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed the Crotone game due to the positive test for coronavirus, and he is rated doubtful for the Spezia game. The White and Blacks, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Sassuolo, and regardless of which players will be deployed in Milan’s starting XI, home win should be considered.",V,2020-2021
414,2020-10-04,Juventus,Napoli,"There will be fireworks when Juventus and Napoli face each other at Allianz Stadium in the Serie A derby. The Bianconeri recorded a routine 3-0 win over Sampdoria in the season opener, with the team dropping two points in a 2-2 draw with Roma at Stadio Olimpico. Cristiano Ronaldo has already found his goal-scoring touch, and the Portugal superstar will be the man to watch in the home team. Adrien Rabiot, on the other hand, misses the game through suspension, as well as Bernardeschi, Alex Sandro, and De Ligt. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to build on a splendid 6-0 victory over Genoa, and they are eager to spoil Juve’s party in Torino. Considering that the reigning champions were anything but impressive in the 2-2 draw with Roma, share of spoils is on the cards. It has to be noted that Lorenzo Insigne is out of contention for the visitors after suffering an injury in the triumph over Genoa.",N,2020-2021
415,2020-10-17,Napoli,Atalanta,"All eyes will be on Stadio San Paolo when Napoli and Atalanta go head to head in the Serie A derby. The Neapolitans made a flying start to the season, with the team beating both Parma and Genoa in the first two league fixtures. The Partenopei are eyeing their third consecutive clean sheet in the Italian top flight, but preventing Atalanta attackers from scoring is easier said than done. The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to build on a 5-2 win over Cagliari. 

The visitors are eager to keep their 100% record in the 2020/21 season intact, and given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Insigne is sidelined with injury for the hosts, while Elmas and Zielinski are rated doubtful after the duo was tested positive for coronavirus. Atalanta, on the other hand, will be without Piccini, Gollini, Caldara, and Pessina in Saturday’s football match. ",N,2020-2021

The Nerazzurri have been scoring goals for fun at the start of the season, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play in the local derby. Sensi is banned for the hosts, while the likes of Young, Gagliardini, Nainggolan, Radu, Vecino, Bastoni, and Skriniar are all rated doubtful after they were tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-0 win over Spezia. Milan aim to overtake Atalanta in top position in the standings, but, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from the Derby della Madonnina. Musacchio remains in the recovery room, while Gabbia and Duarte are major doubts (coronavirus). Anyhow, share of spoils is on the cards as the two local rivals seem to be evenly matched at the moment.",N,2020-2021

Sampdoria quickly made amends for back-to-back losses to Juventus and Benevento, with the team beating Fiorentina 2-1 on the road in their last league match. La Samp aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry on Matchday 4. The good news for the hosts is that attacker Balde Keita has left the quarantine. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, are after their fourth consecutive win over Sampdoria in the Serie A. The start of the season has been a mixed bag for the capital club, but they are still seen as favourites to win the Stadio Luigi Ferraris clash. The likes of Lulic, Marusic, Proto, and Radu remain in the recovery room for the visitors, but key footballers should start the match. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic helped Serbia beat Norway in the Euro 2021 playoffs semis, and he should help Lazio beat Sampdoria as well.",P,2020-2021

The Bianconeri dropped two points in a 2-2 draw with Roma, but reputable bookies see the title holders as hot favourites to win Saturday’s football game. Adrien Rabiot is banned for the Crotone game, while talented defender De Ligt remains in the recovery room for the visitors. 

The hosts, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level at the start of the season. Crotone have already conceded ten goals in the process, and even though Cristiano Ronaldo was tested positive for coronavirus, we do not believe that the underdogs are capable of claiming a major scalp on Matchday 4. The likes of Crespi and Cuomo are both sidelined through injury, but there are no suspended player in the home team. ",P,2020-2021

The Rossoblu have been having their ups and downs at the start of the season, and, as before, they produce much better performances at home than on the travels. Denmark international Skov Olsen suffered an injury while on international duty, and, no doubt, he is going to be sorely missed in Sunday’s showdown. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, aim to stick to their attacking style of play. Sassuolo have been scoring goals for fun at the start of the season, and they should take advantage of Skov Olsen’s absence. As for the visitors, the likes of Chiriches, Romagna, Rogerio, and Magnanelli remain in the recovery room.",P,2020-2021

The Viola have recorded only one win so far this season, but it seems as if their performances are much better than the results. Fiorentina will not have a better chance than this to get back on course, and you should bear in mind that there are no absentees in the away team, except for Chiesa, who joined Juve on the deadline day. 

Spezia, on the other hand, head into the match with a severely-weakened squad. The likes of Ramos, Mastinu, Deiola, and Zoet are sidelined with injury, while Ismajli (fitness), Mattiello (fitness), and Marchizza (coronavirus) are rated doubtful for the hosts. It has to be noted that the two teams meet for the first time ever in the Italian elite division. ",P,2020-2021
421,2020-10-18,Torino,Cagliari,"Torino will be aiming to record their first win of the season when they host Cagliari at their Stadio Olimpico di Torino on Sunday afternoon. Even though Il Toro experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-2 loss to Atalanta, the hosts are seen as favourites to beat Cagliari on Matchday 4 as the Sardinians’ defence has been pretty shaky at the start of the season. Baselli is the only absentee in the home team as he is still recovering from a knee injury. 

Cagliari, on the other hand, will be without injured midfielder Pereiro in the Stadio Olimpico di Torino clash. In their last encounter in the Serie A Cagliari defeated Torino 4-2, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge. The Rossoblu boss Walter Zenga will watch the game from the stands, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered. ",V,2020-2021
422,2020-10-18,Udinese,Parma,"Sunday’s football game at Dacia Arena pits together Udinese and Parma. Udinese made a slow start to the season, with the team losing to Verona, Spezia, and Roma, meaning that they are low on confidence ahead of the visit of Parma. The Zebrette have yet to find the net in the new Serie A campaign, but they should not be underestimated when playing at home ground. 

The likes of Jajalo, Mandragora, and Musso are definitely out of contention with injury, while Stryger Larsen, Deulofeu, and Wallace are rated doubtful for the hosts. Parma, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Verona, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travellers, we are tempted to put our money on draw. The likes of Scozzarella and Cornelius should be the only absentees in the away team ahead of the trip to Udine. ",N,2020-2021

The Romans aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Udinese where summer signing Pedro scored the winner. The pacey Spanish winger will be the man to watch in the home team in Saturday’s football match, but keep in mind that both Pastore and Zaniolo are out of contention through injury. 

The Gli Stregoni, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 5-2 loss to Inter on day 2, but they did well to beat Bologna thanks to Gianluca Lapadula’s goal before the international break. Since Moncini suffered a loss in the last league fixture, Lapadula is likely to lead the line for the visitors against Roma. Anyhow, home win should be considered as the Romans have turned their Stadio Olimpico into a real fortress.",V,2020-2021

Hellas Verona aim to keep their 100% record at home intact, but keep in mind that the likes of Danzi, Benassi, Di Carmine, Cetin, and Dawidowicz are out of contention through injury. 

Both Barak and Gunter are rated doubtful after the duo was positive on coronavirus. Genoa, on the other hand, have been dealing with coronavirus epidemic as well, with all Pjaca, Pellegrini, Melegoni, Schone, Biraschi, Zappacosta, Criscito, Behrami, and Zajc being tested positive. Seeing that several first-team regulars could miss the game through illness, we are tempted to put our money on Ivan Juric’s troops this time out. ",V,2020-2021

The Neroverdi are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Il Toro. A man to keep an eye in the home team will be Serbia international Filip Djuricic, who has been producing excellent displays of late for both Sassuolo and the national team. 

Torino, on the other hand, are on a three-game losing run in the Serie A, and given Sassuolo’s impressive home record, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. Romagna and Haraslin are sidelined with injury for the hosts, while Toljan is rated doubtful. Baselli, on the other hand, is out of contention through injury for the visitors. ",V,2020-2021

The Orobici experienced all sorts of problems at the back in the Stadio San Paolo clash, but they should now focus on the upcoming fixtures. The likes of Caldara and Gollini remain in the recovery room, while Carnesecchi (illness) is rated doubtful. 

La Samp, on the other hand, did well to beat Immobile-less Lazio 3-0 in their last league match. Claudio Ranieri’s men aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but beating Atalanta in Bergamo is easier said than done. The Orobici are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and they are surely capable of defeating La Samp, who are not regarded as good travellers. Manolo Gabbiadini is likely to miss the game with injury for the visitors.",V,2020-2021

The Nerrazzuri are determined to put an end to Juventus’ dominance in the Italian top flight, and, no doubt, they will go for a win in Saturday’s football match. The likes of Young, Skriniar, Radu, Nainggolan, and Gagliardini are all rated doubtful for the game after they were tested positive for coronavirus. 

Vecino, on the other hand, remains in the recovery room. Genoa have been having their ups and downs at the start of the season, with the team beating Crotone, losing to Napoli, while sharing the spoils with Verona in the “City of Love”. The Rossoblu are tough to beat at home, but seeing that Inter do not suit them, home win should not be considered.

Immobile returns to the starting line-up against Bologna, but the likes of Lazzari, Luiz Felipe, Radu, Proto, Vavro, and Quissanga are all likely to miss the match with injury. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, suffered a 4-3 loss to Sassuolo on Matchday 4. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, and seeing that Ciro Immobile returns for the capital club, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Twelve goals in total have been netted in the previous three meetings between the two clubs. The likes of Dijks, Medel, Poli, and Skov Olsen are sidelined with injury for the visiting team.

The Sardinians recorded their first win of the season at the weekend, but, no doubt, they do not want to stop now. Crotone, on the other hand, did well to hold Ronaldo-less Juve to a draw, with the team picking up their first point of the season. 

Giovanni Stroppa’s troops aim to escape the relegation zone, but beating Cagliari in Sardinia is easier said than done. A close encounter is on the cards at Sardegna Arena, and we believe that punters can find value in betting on draw. Ceppitelli and Pereiro are likely to miss the game for the hosts, while Benali and Riviere are major doubts for the visiting team. ",N,2020-2021

Summer signing Victor Osimhen, who opened his goalscoring account against the Orobici, is widely expected to lead the line for the visitors. 

The likes of Elmas and Zielinski are both likely to leave the quarantine before the Benevento game, while Insigne is rated doubtful for the match. The hosts, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 5-2 loss to Roma. Benevento obviously struggle at the back, and given Napoli’s attacking potential, anything but a routine away win would be a major surprise.

Fabio Liverani can’t count on Cornelius, Sprocati, and Mihaila, while Valenti, Dezi, Inglese, and Brunetta are rated doubtful. 

The visitors, on the other hand, showed character in their last league match, with the team coming from two goals behind to share the spoils with Fiorentina. Spezia look sharp in front of goal, and given Parma’s shaky defence, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

Boss Iachini has a full squad to choose from ahead of the visit of Udinese; therefore, it seems as if Fiorentina will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, quickly bounced back from a 1-0 loss to Roma, with the team beating Parma 3-2 in their last league match.

The Mastini, on the other hand, have been playing some low-scoring games of late. Following a 1-0 loss to Parma, Verona played out a goalless draw with Genoa on Matchday 4, but preventing Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. from scoring is easier said than done.

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, aim to build on a 5-2 win over Benevento, but given Milan’s form at the start of the season, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on the capital club.

The Rossoblu made a slow start to the season, with the team collecting only one point from possible 15, and it is no wonder bookies seem them as big underdogs in Saturday’s clash. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, are eager to make amends for back-to-back defeats to Napoli and Sampdoria, and they will not have a better chance than this to do so. Considering that influential attacker Josip Ilicic has returned to contention after overcoming some personal issues, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visiting team.

Speaking of CR7, he should return to the starting XI after overcoming coronavirus. 

Juve failed to turn their dominance into victory in the 1-1 draw with Verona, and they are surely capable of beating Spezia on Matchday 6.

The Zebrette, on the other hand, have already suffered five defeats in the new Serie A campaign, and it is no wonder they are seen as underdogs in Friday’s showdown. The likes of Toljan and Haraslin are rated doubtful for the hosts, while Caputo and Romagna should miss out through injury.

The likes of Ceppitelli, Pinna, and Luvumbo are all likely to miss the game with injury for the hosts. 

La Samp, on the other hand, shared the spoils with Genoa in the Derby della Lanterna, with the team failing to extend their winning run in the Serie A to four games. Fabio Quagliarella is not getting any older, and the Italian veteran is widely expected to be deployed up front, alongside Gaston Ramirez.

The Red and Yellows will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways as they play host to Spezia at their Stadio Ciro Vigorito. 

The visitors experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Juventus, and given the importance of the match for Benevento, we predict that the hosts are going to pick up all three points from the game. Caprari is banned for the hosts, while both Iago Falque and Barba are likely to miss the match with injury.

Keep in mind that the Gli Emiliani are eyeing their second home win of the season. The Viola, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss at Roma. Fiorentina have been having their ups and downs at the start of the season, but given Parma’s shaky defence, the visitors are surely capable of finding the net in the Stadio Ennio Tardini clash.

Luis Alberto is the only starter who is out of contention through injury. 

Juve, on the other hand, welcome Cristiano Ronaldo back to the starting XI as he was tested negative for coronavirus before the Spezia game. CR7 came as a substitute to score a brace at the weekend, and, no doubt, he is going to prove a handful for the opposition defenders.

Experienced midfielder Miguel Veloso is pushing for a start after scoring as a substitute in the victory over Atalanta, while Ruegg, Magnani, Benassi, Vieira, Kalinic, and Gunter are sidelined with injury. 

Serbia international Darko Lazovic (coronavirus) is rated doubtful for the game. The Sardinians, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 2-2 draw with Spezia, and given their anything but good away record in the Serie A, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts.

The Giallorossi are a real force to ber reckoned with at home, and it has to be noted that they are after their fourth consecutive home win in the Italian top flight. 

Keep in mind, though, that the likes of Mancini, Santon, Pastore, Veretout, and Zaniolo are all sidelined with injury. Sassuolo failed to impress in a 3-0 loss to Inter, but given their attacking potential, we believe that over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered. You should bear in mind that 16 goals in total have been netted in the previous two meetings between the two teams in the Italian top flight. The likes of Caputo, Defrel, Romagna, and Chiriches are all out of contention through injury for the visitors.",N,2020-2021

Benevento made a slow start to the season, but they have been showing signs of improvement of late, with the team beating Fiorentina on the road, while sharing the spoils with Ronaldo-less Juventus. The hosts aim to escape the danger zone, and they are surely capable of matching Parma behind closed doors. 

Schiattarella is banned, while Maggio, Volta, Caldirola, and Iago Falque are all sidelined with injury. The hosts, on the other hand, desperately needed a win at Genoa, and they managed to get one. Parma aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but given Benevento’s current form, we are tempted to put our money on draw.

Udinese aim to keep on climbing the standings, and they must be high on spirits ahead of the visit of Atalanta. 

Arslan is banned for the hosts, while De Maio, Mandragora, Ouwejan, Lasagna, Nestorovski, and Okaka remain in the recovery room. The Orobici, on the other hand, are paying price for playing on three fronts in the 2020/21 season.

Matteo Politano is pushing for a start after finding the net as a substitute in the triumph over Roma. 

Amir Rrahmani, who has been tested positive for coronavirus, is the only absentee in the away team. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, have been struggling in front of goal of late, with the team failing to find the net in the previous three league fixtures. Napoli emerged triumphant in each of their previous four meetings with Crotone, and, taking everything into account, anything but a routine away win should be a major surprise. ",P,2020-2021

Even though key attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has yet to overcome his injury, Stefano Pioli’s troops are seen as favourites to win Sunday’s clash. It has to be noted that Milan are eyeing their fifth consecutive win on the road in the national championship. 

Rafael Leao is yet another absentee in the away team. La Samp, on the other hand, played out a 2-2 draw with Torino at the weekend, with the team extending their winless run to five games. In their last meeting in Genoa Milan defeated Sampdoria 4-1, which is yet another reason why away win should be considered. Keita (muscle injury) is the only absentee in the home team.",P,2020-2021

The Viola have been struggling in front of goal of late, with the team failing to find the net in the previous four league fixtures, but the game against Genoa could be the turning point for the hosts. Since Cesare Prandelli has a full squad to choose from, home win should definitely be considered. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss to Parma at the weekend, with the team extending their losing run in the Serie A to four games. Since Genoa are not regarded as good travellers, we believe that the time has come for Sampdoria to get back on course in the Italian top flight.

The Neroverdi failed to find the net in the previous two league fixtures, but bookies still see them as hot favourites to win Friday’s football game. The good news for the hosts is that Defrel should be fit to face Benevento on Matchday 11. 

The visitors, on the other hand, are undefeated in the previous three league fixtures. Following a hard-fought 1-0 win over Fiorentina, Benevento shared the spoils with Juve and Parma in the previous two Serie A games, but they will have a big fish to fry against Sassuolo.

The Rossoblu have been struggling in front of goal of late, with the team failing to find the net in the previous four league fixtures, and, no doubt, they are low on confidence ahead of Saturday’s clash. To make things even worse for the home team, midfielder Jacopo Petriccione is sidelined through suspension. 

Spezia, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Lazio. The visitors are eager to escape the relegation zone, and it seems as if they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. When the two teams met at Stadio Ezio Scida in the Serie B earlier in 2020 Spezia defeated Crotone 2-1, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. ",P,2020-2021

The hosts are eager to bounce back from the heart-breaking defeat, but they face a difficult task in the clash against Udinese, who have been making progress week by week. 

The Zebrette were not in action at the weekend, meaning that tired legs are unlikely to prove to be a problem for the visiting team in Saturday’s clash. Udinese aim to build on back-to-back wins over Genoa and Lazio, and they are surely capable of beating the relegation strugglers behind closed doors.

The Biancocelesti aim to climb to the Europa League berth, but the game against Verona will be anything but a walk in the park for Simone Inzaghi’s troops. Lazio have been facing a tough fixture list of late due to their participation in the Champions League, and that is probably the main reason why home win should not be considered. 

Simone Inzaghi can count on key players for Saturday’s match. The Mastini, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Cagliari in their last league match.

Even though Antonio Conte’s men head into Sunday’s clash following the Europa League encounter with Shakhtar Donetsk, away win should be considered as the Nerazzurri have found their best form of late. 

A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Belgium international Romelu Lukaku, who has netted 8 goals in the Serie A so far this season. Cagliari, on the other hand, failed to win the previous three league fixtures, and we do not believe that they are capable of matching the title-chasing side behind closed doors.

The Viola are having a season to forget as well, with the team sitting in the danger zone ahead of the trip to Bergamo. Cesare Prandelli’s men are not regarded as good travellers, and given the importance of the match for the hosts, we predict that the visitors are going to return to Florence empty-handed.

Bologna are tough to beat at home, and you should bear in mind that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are eyeing their fourth home win of the season. 

Talented midfielder Emanuel Vignato, who scored as a substitute in the 3-1 loss to Inter, is pushing for his first Serie A start with Bologna. The Romans, on the other hand, dropped two points in a goalless draw with Sassuolo.

Victor Osimhen should be the only absentee in the home team in Sunday’s clash against Sampdoria. 

The Genoese, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Milan. La Samp managed to find the net in each of their previous four league fixtures, and given Napoli’s tough fixture list, we predict that the visitors will extend their goalscoring run at Stadio San Paolo.

Alvaro Morata remains on the sidelines through suspension, but duo Ronaldo – Dybala is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, continue to struggle in the Italian top flight, with the team sitting in the relegation zone ahead of the visit of Juve.

Even though Zlatan Ibrahimovic is unlikely to recover in time to face Parma, the league leaders are seen as hot favourites to win the match. 

Samu Castillejo, who scored as a substitute in the 2-1 win over Sampdoria, is pushing for a start, as well as talented Norway attacker Hauge.

Inter will be fully focused on the Serie A in the remainder of the season as they suffered elimination in the Champions League, and, no doubt, they will produce much better displays in the national championship. 

The likes of Nainggolan, Pinamonti, Sanchez, Vecino, and Vidal are all likely to miss the Spezia game through injuries.

The good news for the hosts is that key attacker Caputo has overcome his injury. Serbia international Filip Djuricic is widely expected to return to the starting XI against Milan. 

The Rossoneri dropped two points in a 2-2 draw with Genoa, and, no doubt, they are desperate to return to winning ways. However, beating Sassuolo in Reggio Emilia is easier said than done.

The likes of Bennacer, Gabbia, Ibrahimovic, and Saelemakers remain in the recovery room for the hosts. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Udinese, and they managed to get one in style.

Benevento aim to retain their spot in top ten, but they will have to do it without Iago Falque, Viola, Moncini, Caldirola, Letizia, and Volta, who are sidelined with injuries. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to climb to the Champions League berth. Atalanta head into the match following back-to-back wins over Sassuolo (5-1) and Parma (3-0), and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Benevento.

Stefano Pioli’s troops, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 3-0 loss to Atalanta, with Hakan Calhanoglu being sorely missed. The Turkey international remains in the recovery room, with Gabbia and Bennacer missing the match with injuries as well. Stefano Pioli has a number of high-profile footballers to choose from, and we predict that the league leaders are going to return to winning ways in the Italian top flight on Saturday.

You should bear in mind that the Bianconeri are eyeing their only second home win of the season. 

The likes of Piccoli, Saponara, Capradossi, Ferrer, and Mattiello are all out of contention with injuries. Udinese, on the other hand, did well to hold Inter to a goalless draw, with the back-line preventing the Nerazzurri from creating a descent goalscoring opportunity.

Nandez is sidelined through suspension, while Farago, Ounas, Rog, and Luvumbo are all out of contention with injuries. Carboni remains quarantined following his positive test for coronavirus. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, failed to win the previous three league fixtures. Sassuolo are eager to keep their Europa League hopes alive, and they should take advantage of Cagliari’s current form.

Messias is rated doubtful for the match. Genoa, on the other hand, picked up vital three points from the Cagliari clash, with the team moving away from the relegation zone. Davide Ballardini’s charges are tough to beat at home, but given their anything but brilliant away record, we are tempted to put our money on draw.

Bologna, though, are not regarded as good travellers, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Napoli’s party at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.

Antonio Conte is doing a great job with Inter, and given the team’s attacking potential, we are positive that the league leaders are going to find the net in Monday’s clash. Midfielder Sensi should be the only absentee in the home team. 

Atalanta, on the other hand, rolled over Crotone 5-1 in midweek to stay in the Champions League berth. Since the Orobici have been impressive in front of goal of late as well, we believe that punters can find value in betting on both teams to score.

Spezia, on the other hand, came from behind to share the spoils with Benevento in their last league match.

There are no fresh injury worries in the away team, which is yet another reason why odds for Inter’s win have been dropping. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-2 loss to Crotone. The hosts are low on confidence ahead of the visit of Inter, and, taking everything into account, anything but a routine away win would be a major surprise.

As always, a man to watch in the home team will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored the equalizer in the 2-2 draw with Torino in the Turin derby. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are stuck in the middle of the standings, meaning that they have little to play for in the season finale. Strootman is banned for the visitors, while Pellegrini is out of contention with injury.

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, will be without Bourabia, Defrel, and Ayhan in Wednesday’s clash, while Caputo and Berardi are major doubts. Sassuolo did well to hold Roma to a 2-2 draw in their last home game, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travellers, we are tempted to put our money on Antonio Conte’s troops.

Ramos has been tested positive for coronavirus, while both Dell’orco and Saponara remain on the sidelines with injuries. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, have collected only 15 points in the Serie A this season, and, as a result, their top flight status is in great danger. Given Crotone’s three-game losing run in the Italian elite division, we believe that home win should be considered. Perreira (suspension) should be the only absentee in the away team. ",V,2020-2021

All Foulon, Tula, and Moncini are in the recovery room, but there are no suspended players in the home side. The Zebrette, on the other hand, are stuck in the middle of the standings, meaning that the hosts want this win more than the visitors.

The reigning champions have slim chances of defending their title, and, as things stand now, they would be more than happy with a top-four finish.

Aleksandar Kolarov and Arturo Vidal remain in the recovery room, but Antonio Conte has no fresh injury worries ahead of the visit of Verona. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team losing each of their last three league fixtures. Verona have absolutely nothing to play for in the season finale, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered.

Samuel Di Carmine remains on the sidelines with injury, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, picked up vital three points from the Verona game, with the team moving one step closer to regaining Scudetto.

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are having a season to forget as they failed to secure the Serie A survival. Parma are on a six-game losing run in the Italian top flight, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Lazio’s party in the “Eternal City”.

All Damsgaard, Ekdal, Yoshida, and Verre are pushing for a start. Spezia, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 4-1 loss to Napoli. 

The Bianconeri are only three points clear of the relegation zone, and we are positive that they will leave their hearts on the field. However, beating Sampdoria in Genoa is easier said than done, and we believe that punters can find value in betting on draw.

Andrea Pirlo should have a full squad to choose from, with Paulo Dybala pushing for a start. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, have been in a fine form in the season finale, with the team recording five wins in the previous six league fixtures.

Torino are not regarded as good hosts, with the team recording only three wins on home soil in the process, and that is probably the main reason why we are not tempted to put our money on Davide Nicola’s charges. Milan did well to crush Juventus 3-0 in the Serie A derby at the weekend, and they are surely capable of beating the relegation strugglers in Turin.

Considering that Sampdoria look sharp in front of goal at the moment, we predict that they are going to find the net in Monday’s clash. 

New boss Roberto D’Aversa should have a full squad to choose from for the Serie A opener. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, will be without injured duo Kessie-Ibrahimovic in the Stadio Luigi Ferraris showdown.

The Zebrette showed character in their opener, with the team coming from two goals behind to share the spoils with Juve, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as favourites to win Friday’s game. Rodrigo de Paul joined Atletico Madrid earlier this summer, and, in his absence, a man to watch in the home team will be Argentina international Roberto Pereyra. 

Gerard Deulofeu is pushing for a start, while Ilija Nestorovski remains in the recovery room. The newcomers, on the other hand, failed to make life difficult for ten-man Napoli (0-2) in their opener.

Fellow new recruit Hakan Calhanoglu impressed in the season opener as well, and he is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The good news for the vising team is that important attacker Lautaro Martinez returns from suspension. The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Sassuolo, but seeing that they experienced all sorts of problems at the back in their opener, we are tempted to put our money on Simone Inzaghi’s troops.

A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who impressed in the triumph over Empoli, while both Danilo Cataldi and Bobby Adekanye remain in the recovery room. 

Spezia, on the other hand, are not regarded as good travelers, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the capital club.

Adrien Rabiot is sidelined with a muscle injury. Empoli, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 defeat to Lazio, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign.

La Samp, on the other hand, are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but they often struggle on the travels. Given Sassuolo’s display in the triumph over Verona, we predict that the visitors are going to return to Genoa empty-handed.

In Ibrahimovic’s absence, summer signing Olivier Giroud is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts. The Sardinians, on the other hand, often struggle on the road, and we do not believe that they are capable of grabbing something from the match.

Zaniolo is banned for the match, while both Smalling and Spinazzola are likely to miss the game through injuries. Salernitana, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2 loss to Bologna, meaning that a high-scoring affair is on the cards at Stadio Arechi.

I Lagunari, on the other hand, made a promising start to the season, but they have been totally out of form in 2022. Since Venezia extended their losing run to nine games at Juventus, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. As for the visiting team, important midfielder Antonio Vacca limped off with injury in the 2-1 loss to Juve, with Romero, Lezzerini, Ebuehi, and Modolo missing out as well. ",V,2021-2022

The attacking partnership of Zapata and Muriel seemed to be in a perfect working order against Venezia, and the duo is likely to prove a handful for Il Toro back-line as well. 

Keep in mind, though, that all Toloi, Pezzella, Malinovsky, Cabezas, and Maehle have been struggling with injuries of late. Ivan Juric’s men, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over Spezia at the weekend, but given their anything but good away record, home win should be considered.

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, faced no difficulties in a 3-1 win over Roma, but that did not help them regain top position in the standings. Inter face yet another must-win situation against Bologna and seeing that the Rossoblu head into the season finale with the lack of motivation, away win should be considered.

Conti is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Rossoblu are fighting hard to secure the Serie A survival as well. Genoa desperately needed a win against Cagliari, and they managed to get one thanks to Milan Badelj’s late goal. Anyhow, a close encounter is on the cards at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris, and we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

Even though all Cuadrado, Arthur, Chiesea, Mckennie, Locatelli, and Kaio Jorge remain in the recovery room, home win should be considered as Venezia are low on spirits ahead of Matchday 35. 

The relegation-threatened visitors are on an eight-game losing run in the Italian top flight; therefore, we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Juve’s party at Allianz Stadium.

The good news for Jose Mourinho is that both Fuzato and Zaniolo are back from suspensions, but Oliveira is banned for the Bologna game.

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Salernitana and Cremonese. Jose Mourinho has a number of high-profile players to choose from as the club chiefs reinforced the club in the summer transfer window, and given Juve’s attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Ante Rebic will continue to lead the line for the hosts, while Rade Krunic is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the match. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are eyeing their first win of the season, but given their anything but good record at San Siro, home triumph should be considered.

Sassuolo, on the other hand, quickly bounced back from a 3-0 loss to Juve, with the team beating Lecce thanks to Domenico Berardi’s goal.

Midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan is sidelined with injury, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom with zero points in their pocket. Cremonese’s main goal is to secure the elite division survival, but we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Inter’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.

Igor is banned for the match, while fellow defenders Dodo and Nikola Milenkovic missing out with injuries, as well as midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli. Verona, on the other hand, have been underperforming in the first half of the season, and given their anything but good away record, we believe that home win should be considered.

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, had a goal unfairly disallowed for offside in a 2-2 draw with Salernitana, and, to make things even worse for Max Allegri, both Juan Cuadrado and Arkadiusz Milik were sent off in the last league clash. The duo is banned for Sunday’s showdown, with all Chiesa, Pogba, Locatelli, Alex Sandro, Szczesny and Rabiot remaining in the recovery room.

The likes of Zeki Celik, Rick Karsdorp, and Georginio Wijnaldum miss out with injuries as well. ",N,2022-2023
1255,2022-10-17,Lecce,Fiorentina,"Following a 2-1 loss to Roma at Stadio Olimpico, Lecce will be aiming to escape the danger zone when they take on Fiorentina in the Serie A round 10. The Giallorossi are eyeing their only second win of the process, but they will have a big fish to fry in Monday’s showdown. Since important midfielder Morten Hjumland misses the match through suspension, we are not tempted to put our money on the home side. 

The Viola, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 4-0 loss to Lazio where they failed to turn their dominance into goals. Fiorentina defeated Lecce in each of their last two meetings at Stadio Via del Mare, which is probably the main reason why away triumph should be considered. Forward Riccardo Sottil is sidelined through injury, while midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli should recover in time to face Lecce. ",P,2022-2023
