0,Fiorentina,Napoli,2019-08-24,P,"Fiorentina play host to Napoli at their Stadio Artemio Franchi on day 3 of the new Serie A campaign. The Viola failed to turn their dominance into victory in a goalless draw with their local rivals Empoli, and it is no wonder they are seen as underdogs in Sunday’s showdown. Despite failing to impress in the Tuscan derby, summer signing Luka Jovic should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while both Gaetano Castrovilli and Igor are out of contention with injuries. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Verona and Monza. The visiting side have been scoring goals for fun at the start of the season, and given Fiorentina’s anything but good display against Empoli, away win should be considered. Midfielder Diego Demme should be the only absentee in the away side. ",P
4,Parma,Juventus,2019-08-24,P,"Parma and Juventus, the two old rivals, face each other at Stadio Ennio Tardini in the Serie A round 13. The Bianconeri dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Atalanta, with the Cristiano Ronaldo failing to score the winner from the penalty spot. Juve have been anything but impressive under Antonio Conte in the 2020/21 season, but the game against Parma could be the turning point for CR7 and Co. Arthur and Demiral should be the only absentees in the away team. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are undefeated in the previous four league fixtures. However, home win should not be considered as both Scozzarella and Pezzella suffered injuries in the goalless draw with Cagliari on Wednesday evening. In their last meeting at Stadio Ennio Tardini Juve defeated Parma thanks to Giorgio Chiellini’s goa, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself.",P
22,Udinese,Milan,2019-08-25,V,"Udinese and Milan face each other in a highly-anticipated Serie A game at Dacia Arena. The Zebrette are on a four-game winless run in the national championship, with the team experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 loss to Empoli. Since Udinese have recorded no more than two wins at home ground this term, we are not tempted to put our money on the underdogs. Samir is banned for the hosts, while both Rodrigo Becao and Pereyra are sidelined with injuries. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, aim to retain top position in the Serie A standings. Stefano Pioli’s troops have been in a fine form of late, and even though their injury list is pretty long, away win should be considered. All Calabria, Kjaer, Castillejo, Giroud, Pellegri, Rafael Leao, Rebic, and Plizzari are injured for the away team.",P
19,Hellas Verona,Bologna,2019-08-25,N,"Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi will host Friday’s Serie A game between Verona and Bologna, the two mid-table sides. The Mastini aim to build on a 4-2 win over Sassuolo, with the team eyeing their first home triumph since November 22, 2021. Both Frabotta and Dawidowicz remain in the recovery room, while a man to watch in the home team will be Antonin Barak, who scored a hat-trick at the weekend. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-0 loss to Napoli. Bologna suffered yet another dip in form, and seeing that Verona have turned their Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi into a real fortress, we predict that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are going to return home empty-handed. Soumaoro is banned for the visitors, while all Dijks, Schouten, and Kingsley are out of contention with injuries. In the first half of the season Bologna defeated Verona 1-0, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge.",V
18,SPAL,Atalanta,2019-08-25,P,"Thanks to a 3-1 win over Sassuolo on the last day of the 2018/2019 Serie A season Atalanta booked their place in the Champions League for the first time ever. The Orobici aim to prepare in the best way possible for their debut in the elite competition, but they first need to kick off the new Serie A season in style. Gian Piero Gasperini’s charges take on SPAL at Stadio Paolo Mazza in their opener and we are positive that the visitors are going to stick to their attacking style of play. 

A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Duvan Zapata, who scored 23 goals in the Italian top flight last term. SPAL played above expectations in the Serie A last season and they surely want to continue where they left. Seeing that Atalanta were struggling in pre-season, we predict that the hosts are going to grab something from Sunday’s football match.",N
11,Roma,Genoa,2019-08-25,N,"Roma will look to build on a 4-2 win over Empoli when they take on Genoa at their Stadio Olimpico on Matchday 24. The Giallorossi have been scoring goals for fun of late, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Tammy Abraham, while Leonardo Spinazzola remains in the recovery room. Both Darboe and Diawara are back from international duty. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, played out a goalless draw with Udinese before the international break. Genoa are not regarded as good travelers, and seeing that they experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 6-0 loss to Fiorentina, we are tempted to put our money on Jose Mourinho’s troops, who are eyeing a place in the Champions League. Cambiaso is banned for the visitors, while both Ghighlione and Rovella miss out with injuries.",V
10,Cagliari,Brescia,2019-08-25,P,"Brescia return to Serie A following an eight-year absence. The Biancazzurri aim to impress on their return to the Italian top flight, but they will have a mountain to climb in Sunday’s football match against Cagliari. 

The Sardinians did well to sign the likes of Nahitan Nandez, Albero Cerri, Fabrizio Cacciatore, Christian Oliva, Federico Mattiello (loan) and Marko Rog (loan) in the summer transfer window and given their fine home record in the Italian top flight, it is no surprise they are seen as favourites to win the opening match of the season. The newcomers, on the other hand, are not regarded as good travelers and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Cagliari’s party at Sardegna Arena. A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be controversial Italian attacker Mario Balotelli, who joined the club earlier this summer. ",V
14,Sampdoria,Lazio,2019-08-25,P,"Sampdoria and Lazio take on each other at Stadio Luigi Ferraris in the Serie A round 4. La Samp are eager to record their first win of the season, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against the capital club. All Manuel De Luca, Andrea Conti, and Simone Trimboli are out of contention with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, are eyeing their third win of the process, and they must be high on spirits following a thrilling 3-1 win over Inter. Ciro Immobile should continue to lead the line for the visitors, while there are no fresh injury worries in the away team. Since Sampdoria suit Lazio, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Maurizio Sarri’s charges. In their last meeting in the Italian top flight Lazio defeated Sampdoria 2-0.",P
6,Torino,Sassuolo,2019-08-25,V,"After failing to spoil Inter’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, Torino will look to move closer to the Conference League berth when they take on Sassuolo on Matchday 7. Il Toro defeated Lecce in their last home game, which is certainly giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of Saturday’s clash. Both Samuele Ricci and Alexey Miranchuk are sidelined with injuries, while summer signing Nemanja Radonjic should be recalled to the starting XI. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, failed to win the previous four league fixtures, and given their difficulties at the back in a 3-1 loss to Udinese, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the home side. Defender Ruan Tressoldi misses the match through suspension, while midfielder Davide Frattesi has yet to recover from a rib injury. ",V
25,Inter,Lecce,2019-08-26,V,"Inter play host to Lecce at their Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in the opening match of the 2019/2020 Serie A campaign. The Nerazzurri did well to reinforce the squad in the summer transfer window and, no doubt, Belgian attacker Romelu Lukaku is the club’s biggest signing. The former Manchester United man is expected to impress in the upcoming Serie A season and all eyes will be on him when Inter take on Lecce in their opener. 

Yet another man to watch in the home team will be Matteo Politano, who joined the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza outfit in a €20 million deal. The Salentini, on the other hand, return to the Italian top flight following a seven-year absence and seeing that Antonio Conte’s men are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the newcomers are unlikely to grab something from the match. ",V
26,Milan,Brescia,2019-08-31,V,"Stadio Giuseppe Meazza will host Saturday’s football game between Milan and Brescia, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2019/2020 season. The Rossoneri suffered a 1-0 loss to Udinese in the opening match of the season, meaning that they are desperate to pick up all three points from the Brescia game. Seeing that key player Mario Balotelli misses the game through suspension for the visitors, we believe that home win should be considered. 

The newcomers did defeat Cagliari in Sardinia in their opener, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza clash. A man to watch in the home team will be Krzysztof Piatek, the Poland international who is eager to open his goal-scoring account. You should know that Milan and Brescia meet in the Serie A for the first time since 2011 when the Rossoneri defeated le Rondinelle. ",V
27,Juventus,Napoli,2019-08-31,V,"There will be fireworks when Juventus and Napoli face each other in the Serie A derby on Matchday 20. The Bianconeri aim to build on back-to-back wins over Bologna and Cagliari, and a triumph over Napoli will see them keep their Scudetto hopes alive. Danilo is sidelined with injury, while all Chiellini, Arthur, Ramsey, De Winter, and Pinsoglio have been tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, made a flying start to the season, but they do not seem to be at their sharpest ahead of the trip to Turin. Luciano Spalletti’s troops suffered three defeats in the previous four league fixtures, and given Juve’s signs of improvement, we believe that home win should be considered. Mario Rui is banned for the visitors, while all Elmas, Lozano, and Osimhen miss out through coronavirus infection. In the first half of the season Napoli defeated Juventus 2-1, meaning that the “Old Lady” is hungry for revenge.",V
30,Cagliari,Inter,2019-09-01,P,"Sunday’s Serie A game at Unipol Domus pits together Cagliari and Inter, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the season finale. The Rossoblu are fighting hard to secure the elite division survival, while the Nerazzurri aim to keep their Scudetto hopes alive. Cagliari showed character in a 1-1 draw with Salernitana, with defender Giorgio Altare scoring the equalizer in the stoppage time. 

First-choice goalkeeper Boris Radunovic is banned for the match, while Nandez continues to miss out with injury. Simone Inzaghi’s troops, on the other hand, aim to build on a come-from-behind 4-2 win over Empoli. A lively contest is on the cards in Sardinia, but we are tempted to put our money on the title-chasing visitors who are more of a team than Cagliari. There are no fresh injury worries in the away team ahead of Sunday’s showdown. ",P
46,Genoa,Fiorentina,2019-09-01,V,"Stadio Luigi Ferraris will host Saturday’s football game between Genoa and Fiorentina, who defeated Cagliari (3-2) and Atalanta (2-1) respectively on Matchday 3. The Rossoblu regained a much-needed confidence at the weekend, but they will have a big fish to fry against Fiorentina. Summer signing Mohamed Fares should be handed his full Genoa debut after scoring a brace in the triumph over Cagliari, while both Caicedo and Badelj are sidelined with injuries. 

The Viola, on the other hand, continue to rely on Serbia rising star Dusan Vlahovic, who scored a brace in the triumph over Atalanta, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on both teams to score. Defender Lorenzo Venuti misses the match through injury, but the 26-year-old should be the only absentee in the away team. ",N
43,Lazio,Roma,2019-09-01,N,"There will be fireworks when Lazio and Roma square off against each other in the Rome derby on Matchday 6. The Biancocelesti aim to put an end to their three-game winless run, and they are likely to adopt an attack-minded approach in Sunday’s showdown. Ciro Immobile, who scored a late equalizer from the penalty spot in the midweek draw with Torino, is likely to lead the line for the hosts. 

The Romans, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Udinese on Thursday evening, with the team retaining their spot in top four. The Giallorossi are likely to go for a win in the local derby as well, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Pellegrini is banned for the visitors, while Spinazzola remains on the sidelines with a long-term injury. ",N
33,Udinese,Parma,2019-09-01,P,"Sunday’s football game at Dacia Arena pits together Udinese and Parma. Udinese made a slow start to the season, with the team losing to Verona, Spezia, and Roma, meaning that they are low on confidence ahead of the visit of Parma. The Zebrette have yet to find the net in the new Serie A campaign, but they should not be underestimated when playing at home ground. 

The likes of Jajalo, Mandragora, and Musso are definitely out of contention with injury, while Stryger Larsen, Deulofeu, and Wallace are rated doubtful for the hosts. Parma, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Verona, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travellers, we are tempted to put our money on draw. The likes of Scozzarella and Cornelius should be the only absentees in the away team ahead of the trip to Udine. ",N
35,Lecce,Hellas Verona,2019-09-01,P,"Stadio Comunale Via del Mare will be packed when Lecce and Hellas Verona square off against each other on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign. The Giallorossi are eager to impress in their first home game of the season and they will not have a better chance than this to pick up all three points as Verona are seen as one of the main candidates to suffer relegation at the end of the season. 

The Mastini played out a 1-1 draw with Bologna at home in their opener, with Polish defender Pawel Dawidowicz being sent off after 13 minutes. The 24-year-old is out of contention through suspension and seeing that Verona are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on Fabio Liverani’s charges. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be summer signing Gianluca Lapadula.",V
40,Sassuolo,Sampdoria,2019-09-01,V,"After beating Verona in the “City of Love” in their opener, Sassuolo will be aiming to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Sampdoria on Matchday 2. The Neroverdi kicked off the new Serie A campaign in style, but they should not stop now. Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, and seeing that all Bourabia, Obiang, and Berardi are eyeing return to the squad, home win should be considered. 

La Samp, on the other hand, are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but they often struggle on the travels. Given Sassuolo’s display in the triumph over Verona, we predict that the visitors are going to return to Genoa empty-handed. In their last meeting at the venue Sassuolo defeated Sampdoria 1-0, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. Midfielder Fabio Depaoli should be fit for Sunday’s showdown.",V
36,Atalanta,Torino,2019-09-01,P,"Atalanta will look to record their third win of the season when they face Torino in the Serie A round 4. The Orobici did well to beat Verona in the City of Love at the weekend, meaning that they are high on spirits ahead of the visit of Torino. All Berat Djimsiti, Marco Carnesecchi, and Davide Zappacosta are out of contention through injuries, while Luis Muriel could earn a spot in the starting XI this time out. 

Il Toro made a promising start to the season as well, with the team beating both Monza and Cremonese, while sharing the spoils with Lazio. Ivan Juric has no fresh selection worries, but both Alexey Miranchuk and David Zima remain in the recovery room. In their last encounter in the Italian top flight the two teams played out a thrilling 4-4 draw, and given their fine forms at the start of the season, yet another high-scoring affair is on the horizon.",N
56,Napoli,Sampdoria,2019-09-14,V,"After sharing the spoils with Juventus in the Serie A derby, Napoli will be aiming to return to winning ways when they host Sampdoria to their Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Matchday 21. All Ounas, Koulibaly, and Anguissa are on international duty, while key attacker Victor Osimhen misses out with a broken cheekbone. Since all Meret, Malcuit, Mario Rui, and Lozano have been tested positive for coronavirus, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on the home side. 

La Samp, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss to Cagliari in their first game of the year. The visitors are desperate to grab something from Sunday’s match, and given the number of absentees in the home team, we are tempted to put our money on draw.

The Nerazzurri are eyeing their third home win of the process, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Zebrette. Simone Inzaghi should have a full squad to choose from this time out, except for Christian Eriksen, who remains on the sidelines through heart problems. 

Both Edin Dzeko and Arturo Vidal are pushing for a start. Udinese, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Verona. The Zebrette were beaten by Inter in each of the previous three meetings between the two sides in Milano, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. Gerard Deulofeu should be the only absentee in the away team. ",V
61,SPAL,Lazio,2019-09-15,V,"SPAL will be aiming to make amends for back-to-back losses to the likes of Atalanta and Bologna when they host Lazio at their Stadio Paolo Mazza on Sunday afternoon. The hosts are desperate to grab something from the match, but beating the Biancocelesti, who have been in a fine form at the start of the season is easier said than done. 

The capital club impressed in their opener, with the team rolling over Sampdoria 3-0 in Genoa and they head into Sunday’s football match following a 1-1 draw with Roma in the fierce local derby. A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Ciro Immobile, who found the net for Italy in a 2-1 win over Finland. Lazio are more of a team than SPAL and seeing that the hosts made a slow start to the season, we are tempted to put our money on the away team.",P

The Giallorossi are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, but keep in mind that both Smalling and Spinazzola remain in the recovery room. 

The likes of Pellegrini, Vina, and Mancini are rated doubtful for the game. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, defeated Verona 3-2 in their first away game of the season, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Midfielder Pedro Obiang should be the only absentee in the away team, whilst Roma defenders should have Domenico Berardi at bay.",V

Defender Federico Ceccherini is banned for the match, but there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, proved their worth in the Serie A derby, with the team recording a routine 2-0 win over Juventus. Stefano Pioli’s men aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and given their current situation in Verona’s dressing room, away win should definitely be considered.

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are playing for coach Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is coping with serious illness and we are positive that they are going to leave their hearts on the field. 

Bologna recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over SPAL at home on Matchday 2, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. You should bear in mind that the two teams shared the spoils in their last meeting in a competitive match. ",N

Parma aim to climb to the top half of the table, and they are surely capable of beating Cagliari, who are low on confidence following a heart-breaking 3-1 loss to Inter. The Sardinians are on a four-game winless run in the Serie A, and given Parma’s display in the draw with Milan, home win should be considered.

Both Malinovsky and Miranchuk should be recalled to the starting XI, while Gosens is out of contention with injury. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are not enjoying a season to remember, with the team collecting only ten points in total to date.

Udinese are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but seeing that the newcomers produced a fine performance in the 4-3 loss to the Rossoblu, we are tempted to put our money on draw. In their last meeting in the Italian top flight back in 2011 the two teams played out a goalless draw. ",N

Parma are on a six-game losing run in the Italian top flight, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Lazio’s party in the “Eternal City”. Even though midfielder Hernani returns from suspension, we are not tempted to put our money on the underdogs, who are low on confidence ahead of the trip to Rome. ",V
100,Hellas Verona,Udinese,2019-09-24,N,"Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi will host Monday’s Serie A game between Verona and Udinese, the two teams who sit in the opposite halves of the table. The Mastini aim to escape the danger zone, but their displays in back-to-back defeats to Lazio (0-2) and Fiorentina (0-2) are not giving fans a reason for optimism. There are no fresh injury worries in the home team, but experienced midfielder Miguel Veloso could sneak into the starting XI. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, have been performing above expectations in the 2022/2023 season, with the team extending their winning run to five games against title-chasing Inter. Since the visitors are high on confidence ahead of the trip to the “City of Love”, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the away side. Defensive duo Adam Masina – Leonardo Buta remains in the recovery room.",P
104,Brescia,Juventus,2019-09-24,P,"After dropping two points in a goalless draw with Fiorentina, Juventus recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over Hellas Verona at the weekend. The Bianconeri aim to overtake Inter in top position in the Serie A standings and we predict that they will go all guns blazing at Brescia on Matchday 5. Maurizio Sarri’s troops are eager to take on Inter on day 7 with six points in their pocket from matches against Brescia and SPAL. 

Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored from the penalty spot against Hellas Verona, will be the man to watch in the away team. Mario Balotelli returns from suspension for the hosts and all eyes will be on the former Inter and Milan attacker when the two teams face each other at Stadio Mario Rigamonti on Tuesday evening. Anyhow, seeing that Maurizio Sarri can count on key players for the Brescia game, away win should be considered.",P
111,Napoli,Cagliari,2019-09-25,P,"Napoli play host to Cagliari at their Stadio Diego Armando Maradona in the Serie A round 6. The Neapolitans aim to build on thrilling back-to-back wins over Udinese (4-0) and Sampdoria (4-0), and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play. A man to watch in the home team will be Nigeria international Victor Osimhen, who scored a brace in the midweek triumph, while Greece international Konstantinos Manolas is likely to return to the starting XI. 

Slovakia midfielder Stanislav Lobotka is out of contention through injury. The Sardinians, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Empoli, and given their shaky defence, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise. Zappa is banned for the visitors, while both Ceter and Rog are out of contention with injuries. Diego Godin and Kevin Strootman are pushing for a start.",V
121,Fiorentina,Sampdoria,2019-09-25,V,"Fiorentina and Sampdoria face each other in a highly-anticipated Serie A game at Stadio Artemio Franchi. The Viola aim to bounce back from a heart-breaking loss to their local rivals Empoli, and they are surely capable of matching La Samp in front of home fans. Serbia rising start Dusan Vlahovic, who scored his 11th goal of the season in the Tuscan derby, will be the man to keep an eye on in the home team, whilst all Benassi, Dragowski, Nastasic, and Pulgar should miss out with injuries. 

Roberto D’Aversa’s troops, on the other hand, came from behind to beat Verona 3-1 in their last league match. The bad news for the visitors, though, is that defender Alex Ferrari limped off with injury at the weekend. Since Sampdoria are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on Dusan Vlahovic and Co. this time out. ",V
110,SPAL,Lecce,2019-09-25,P,"Following a thrilling 2-1 win over Lazio at their Stadio Paolo Mazza, SPAL experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-0 loss at Sassuolo at the weekend. The Gli Estensi sit in the danger zone in the Serie A standings ahead of Matchday 5 and seeing that Lecce were outclassed by Napoli (1-4) in their last league fixture, we are positive that the hosts are going to grab something from Wednesday’s football game at Stadio Paolo Mazza. 

The Giallorossi have already suffered three defeats in the new Serie A campaign and seeing that SPAL are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we predict that the newcomers are going to return home empty-handed from the trip to Ferrara. It has to be noted that the two clubs meet for the first time ever in the Italian elite division. ",V

Genoa suffered a 3-0 loss to Napoli at the weekend, with the Partenopei ruining their survival hopes. The hosts are low on spirits ahead of the visit of Bologna, meaning that home win should not be considered. All Sturaro, Maksimovic, and Vanheusden are sidelined with injuries, while Badelj is a major doubt. 

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team losing to both Venezia and Sassuolo in the previous two league fixtures. Anyhow, both teams to score betting option should be considered as both sides will be with guards down in Saturday’s clash. Sinisa Mihajlovic has a full squad to choose from for the last game of the season. In the first half of the season the two sides played out a 2-2 draw.",N

The Gli Emiliani extended their losing run to seven games in midweek, and, no doubt, they are low on confidence ahead of the visit of Sassuolo. Since all Brugman, Karamoh, Man, Cyprien, Zirkzee, Inglese, Iacoponi, and Caviglia are likely to miss the game with injuries, home win should not be considered. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, suffered a 3-1 loss to Juventus where Domenico Berardi failed to convert a penalty at 0-0. Sassuolo aim to climb to the Europa League Conference berth, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Parma, who will compete in the Serie B from next season.

The Romans aim to build on a 2-1 win over Empoli, but this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the home team. Jose Mourinho can’t count on Rick Karsdorp, Marash Kumbulla, Stephan El Shaarawy, Nicolo Zaniolo, Georginio Wijnaldum, and Ebrima Darboe for the Atalanta clash. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Cremonese. Since the visitors are eager to return to winning ways in the Italian top flight, we believe that gamblers from all around the globe can find value in betting on both teams to score. Summer signing Rasmus Hojlund is pushing for a recall to the starting XI, while all Duvan Zapata, Berat Djimsiti, and Marco Carnesecchi remain in the treatment room. ",N

The Nerazzurri were not in action in midweek as their clash with Bologna was postponed, meaning that tired legs should not prove to be a big problem for the title holders. Halkan Calhanoglu is banned for a match, while Edin Dzeko has been tested positive for coronavirus. 

As always, a man to watch in the home team will be Argentina striker Lautaro Martinez, who is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line. The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-3 draw with Empoli, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Inter’s party in Milano. Defender Francesco Acerbi should be the only absentee in the away team.",V

Tommaso Pobega is back from suspension, while all Zaza, Praet, Djidji, Sanabria, and Fares should miss out with injuries. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, aim to retain top position in the standings. 

Milan dropped two points in a goalless draw with Bologna, and seeing that both Inter and Napoli are breathing down their neck, Sunday’s clash is of big importance for the visiting team. Anyhow, the share of spoils is on the cards as Torino are tough to beat at home. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is pushing for a start, whilst all Kjaer, Romagnoli, and Florenzi are likely to miss the game with injuries. ",N

Sassuolo aim to make amends for a 2-1 loss to Lazio, and we are positive that they will find the net in Sunday’s showdown. Filip Djuricic remains in the recovery room, while Domenico Berardi is a major doubt. Davide Fratessi serves a one-game ban. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, suffered a 3-1 loss to Napoli on Matchday 31. Atalanta have slim chances of securing a top-four finish, but they could still grab a place in European competitions. Given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

The Bianconeri are still without key attacker Cristiano Ronaldo (injury), but attacking duo Gonzalo Higuain – Paulo Dybala is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

Juve are eager to overtake Inter in top position in the standings and we predict that the title holders will go all guns blazing at SPAL on Matchday 6. In previous two home games in the 2019/2020 Serie A season Maurizio Sarri’s men defeated the likes of Napoli and Hellas Verona. Leonardo Semplici’s troops, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back defeats to the likes of SPAL and Lecce and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Juve’s party in Turin.

La Samp have yet to find the net in the new domestic campaign, and, no doubt, they will fight tooth and nail against the Nerazzurri. Fabio Quagliarella, who is not getting any older, is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts, while both Gabbiadini and Torregrossa are out of contention with injuries. 

Bereszynski, on the other hand, will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. Simone Inzaghi’s troops are on a quest to defend their Scudetto. Inter kicked off the new Serie A campaign with back-to-back wins over Genoa (4-0) and Verona (3-1), and given Sampdoria’s difficulties in front of goal, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the away team. Chile international Alexis Sanchez is rated doubtful for the game, but Simone Inzaghi has no fresh injury concerns. ",P

The Neapolitans need to pick up all three points from Sunday’s football game if they are to rejoin the race for the trophy, but they will have to do it without key defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who was sent off in the 1-0 loss to Cagliari. 

Anyhow, the Partenopei, who failed to turn their dominance into goals in the midweek fixture, are likely to beat the newcomers at their Stadio San Paolo. Le Rondinelle, on the other hand, produced a fine performance in a 2-1 loss to Juventus, but they were more than unfortunate not to grab something from the match.

There are no fresh injury worries in the home team, while Matteo Lovato is back from suspension. Experienced attacker Leonardo Pavoletti is pushing for a start. 

Verona, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Sampdoria. The Mastini have little to play for in the season finale, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. The likes of Pandur, Coppola, and Dawidowicz are all out of contention with injuries for the visiting side.

All Bennacer, Florenzi, and Kjaer continue to miss out through injuries, while talented midfielder Sandro Tonali should keep his place in the starting XI after scoring a late winner in Rome. 

Fiorentina, on the other hand, are eyeing a spot in European competitions. Vincenzo Italiano’s men, though, failed to impress in a 2-1 loss to relegation strugglers Salernitana, which is probably the main reason why we are going to bet on the league leaders.

Both Luis Alberto and Pedro are rated doubtful for the game. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, failed to impress in the Derby della Lanterna, and given their three-game losing run, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on the capital club. As for the visiting side, all Cassata, Fares, Rovella, and Caicedo are out of contention with injuries.

The capital club aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss to Atalanta and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Lecce. 

Roma did well to beat Bologna 2-1 in their last away game and seeing that key attacker Edin Dzeko is likely to lead the line for the visitors, we are tempted to put our money on Paulo Fonseca’s troops.

The bad news for the home team is that Gervinho has joined the likes of Grassi, Caviglia, Pezella Giu, Laurini, and Scozzarella in the recovery room. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, were on the verge of beating Napoli at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, but thanks to Lorenzo Insigne’s late goal the Neapolitans eventually picked up one point from the match.

The Gli Emiliani’s main goal is to secure yet another Serie A survival, but they will, as always, collect much more points from home game than from away fixtures. In previous two meetings between the two teams in the Italian top flight SPAL emerged triumphant and that is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

Alessio Dionisi’s troops aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but seeing that the visitors want this win more than the hosts, we are tempted to put our money on Simone Inzaghi’s men. There are no fresh injury worries in the home team ahead of Saturday’s showdown, while Morocco international Abdou Harroui is pushing for a start.",P
198,Milan,Lecce,2019-10-20,N,"Falling Italian giants Milan play host to Lecce at their Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in what could be the turning point for the Rossoneri. New coach Stefano Pioli is eager to help Milan footballers regain a much-needed confidence and seeing that they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course in the Serie A, home win should be considered. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, head into Sunday’s football match following back-to-back defeats to the likes of Roma and Atalanta and given the importance of the game for the hosts, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed from the trip to Milano. In their last meeting at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza (2012) Milan recorded a 2-0 win over Lecce, with the likes of Nocerino and Ibrahimovic scoring for the Bianconeri. Taking everything into account, we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. ",V
187,Cagliari,SPAL,2019-10-20,V,"Following three consecutive wins, Cagliari shared the spoils with the likes of Hellas Verona and Roma in previous two league fixtures. The Sardinians made a promising start to the season, but head coach Rolando Maran must warn his men against complacency as SPAL proved their worth in a hard-fought 1-0 win over Parma. The visitors, though, will be without suspended midfielder Espeto in Sunday’s football match and that is one of the main reasons why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. 

The Biancazzurri are not regarded as good travelers and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Cagliari’s party at Sardegna Arena. In their last meeting in Sardinia Cagliari recorded a 2-1 win over SPAL and you should bear in mind that the Biancazzurri have never defeated the Rossoblu on the road in the Italian elite division.",V

The Delfini are eyeing their third win of the season and their first home triumph of the process. The newcomers are likely to leave their hearts on the field, but beating in-form Fiorentina is easier said than done. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be controversial attacker Mario Balotelli, who has netted one goal in the Italian top flight so far this term. 

The Viola have been showing signs of improvement of late and the visitors will be looking to extend their winning run to four games in the Serie A when they face Brescia at Stadio Mario Rigamonti. However, seeing that Fiorentina will be without injured star Federico Chiesa, share of spoils is on the cards. ",N

The Mastini have established themselves as a top-table side in the Italian top flight, but the game against Sassuolo will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. The club chiefs did well to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, but keep in mind that both Lasagna and Faraoni are likely to miss the season opener. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, were producing fine displays in pre-season, with the team beating both Parma and Vicenza, while sharing the spoils with Lazio. Considering that Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Centre-back Marlon is no longer part of the team, while Kyriakopoulos is banned for the match. Obiang is yet another absentee in the away team.",N

The Rossoblu are on a three-game losing run in the Italian top flight, with the team conceding 11 goals in total in previous three league fixtures. The situation in their dressing room is alarming ahead of the visit of Brescia and we predict that the hosts are going to leave their hearts on the field in the relegation six-pointer. 

The Delfini, on the other hand, have been struggling to find their best form at the start of the season, but it seems as if their performances are better than their results. Anyhow, in their last meeting at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris Genoa emerged triumphant and given the importance of Saturday’s clash for the hosts, we predict that the history is going to repeat itself.

The likes of Skriniar, Cagliardini, and Radu have all been tested positive for coronavirus, but Antonio Conte can count on key players for the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza showdown. 

Parma, on the other hand, have been struggling at the back of late, with the team conceding five goals in total in the previous two league fixtures. Considering that Inter are determined to put an end to Juve’s dominance in the Serie A, home win should definitely be considered. The likes of Inglese, Busi, Sprocati, Osorio, Mihaila, Scozzarella, Brunetta, and Valenti have all been struggling with injuries for the visiting team.",V

The newcomers aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but they will have a big fish to fry in the clash against league leaders Juventus. Lecce suffered a loss in each of their first three home games of the season, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the Bianconeri. 

Maurizio Sarri’s troops are on a five-game winning run in the Italian top flight and seeing that Inter are breathing down their neck, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the title holders. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a beautiful goal in a 2-1 win over Bologna and we predict that he is going to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. ",P

Carlo Ancelotti’s men have been impressive at the back of late, keeping a clean sheet in previous two league fixtures, and they are likely to rely on their rock-solid defence against SPAL. 

The hosts sit in the relegation zone in the Serie A table ahead of Matchday 9 and seeing that they failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Cagliari in Sardinia at the weekend, we do not believe that they are capable of matching the title-chasing side.

The Viola have been having their ups and downs of late, with the team losing to both Bologna and Atalanta, while beating Verona. Fiorentina produce much better showings at home than on the travels, but they will have a mountain to climb in Sunday’s showdown. Luka Jovic is pushing for a start, while Dodo has yet to overcome a calf injury. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, are eyeing their fourth consecutive league win, and given their display in a 4-0 crushing of Spezia, we predict that Giovanni Martusciello’s troops are going to emerge triumphant in the Stadio Artemio Franchi clash as well. With no fresh injury worries to report, Giovanni Martusciello is unlikely to make changes to the team that outplayed the Bianconeri.",P

A man to watch in the home team will be Josip Ilicic, who has been scoring goals for fun of late for both Atalanta and Slovenia national team. The likes of Hateboer, Toloi, Pessina, Djimsiti, and Gosens are sidelined with injuries for the home team. 

As for the visitors, Udinese failed to win the previous five league fixtures. Considering that the Zebrette have been struggling at the back of late, we are tempted to put our money on Atalanta, who aim to represent Italy in the Champions League for yet another season. Pereyra is banned for the visiting team, while all Success, Perez, and Nestorovski are out of contention with injuries.",V

Il Toro produced a fine display in a 1-1 draw with their local rivals Juventus, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as favourites to beat the Rossoblu. Fit-again attacker Andrea Belotti should continue to lead the line for the hosts after finding the net in the Turin derby, while Mandragora misses out through suspension. 

Both Fares and Praet are injured. The Sardinians, on the other hand, did well to hold Napoli to a 1-1 draw in front of home fans, but given their poor away record in the 2021/2022 season, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the home team.

Sinisa Mihajlovic should have a full squad to choose from for Sunday’s clash. 

La Samp, on the other hand, suffered an embarrassing 3-0 defeat to Monza in front of home fans, and as a result, Marco Giampaolo is no longer in charge of the team. Dejan Stankovic could replace Giampaolo as a new Sampdoria boss, but, taking everything into account, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors, who are on a four-game losing run in the Serie A. Forward Manuel De Luca remains on the sidelines with a meniscus problem. ",V

Both Smalling and Spinazzola are out of contention with injuries for the capital club. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, did well to beat Torino 1-0 thanks to Olivier Giroud’s goal, with the team retaining top position in the standings. Milan, though, will have a much bigger fish to fry in Sunday’s derby. A close encounter is on the cards in the “Eternal City”, and we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

The Nerazzurri are only one point behind league leaders Juventus, meaning that a win over Brescia could see them regain top position in the standings. 

Antonio Conte is doing a great job with the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza outfit and since le Rondinelle experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 loss to Genoa, we are tempted to put our money on the title-chasing side. A man to watch in the home team will be controversial attacker Mario Balotelli, whilst Brescia defenders should have Romelu Lukaku at bay. You should bear in mind that it has been eight years since the two teams last met in the Italian top flight. Back then they played out a 1-1 draw at Stadio Mario Rigamonti.",P

Parma aim to continue where they left last term, but the game against Verona will be anything but a walk in the park for Gervinho and Co. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, kicked off the new Serie A campaign in the best way possible, with the team outplaying Roma and Udinese without conceding. Verona aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and they are surely capable of spoiling Parma’s party at an empty Stadio Ennio Tardini.

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops, on the other hand, are hit by coronavirus, with all Van Hooijdonk, Hickey, Dominguez, Medel, Viola, Molla, and Vignato being quarantined.

Ciro Immobile, who scored a hat-trick in Genoa, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, head into the match following a goalless draw with Milan. Ivan Juric’s men are eyeing their third consecutive clean sheet, but preventing Lazio attackers from scoring at Stadio Olimpico is easier said than done.

The league leaders dropped two points in a 2-2 draw with Sassuolo, and, no doubt, they are eager to return to winning ways as soon as possible. The bad news for the hosts, though, is that key defender Kalidou Koulibaly suffered an injury in the midweek draw. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, rolled over Venezia 4-0 in their last league match. Atalanta are on a four-game winning run in the Italian top flight, and given their attacking potential, we believe that over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered.

Sampdoria’s performances are better than their results and that is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the rock-bottom side. 

Lecce were more than fortunate to hold star-studded Juventus to a 1-1 draw in their last league fixture and given the importance of Wednesday’s football match for the hosts, we predict that the newcomers are going to return home empty-handed from the trip to Genoa.

Brescia's woeful home record this season calls for a swift improvement while Torino, after their home showing against Juve, are naturally the team with more confidence. Overall, both sides have been mediocre and will fancy their chances against an equally weak opponent. We believe that Torino edge this game.",P
276,Napoli,Genoa,2019-11-09,N,"Buoyed by a hard-fought 1-0 win over Torino, Napoli will be aiming to cement third place in the standings when they host Genoa to their Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Poland international Piotr Zielinski is pushing for a start, while there are no fresh selection worries in the home team. Nigeria international Victor Osimhen is widely expected to lead the line for Luciano Spalletti’s side. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, recorded a very important 2-1 win over Juventus at the weekend to keep their survival hopes alive. Genoa, though, are not regarded as good travelers, which is probably the main reason why we are going to bet on the Neapolitans this time out. Iceland forward Albert Gudmundsson is pushing for recall, while trio Vanheusden – Piccoli – Sturaro remains in the recovery room. In their last meeting at the venue Napoli crushed Genoa 6-0.",V
291,Parma,Roma,2019-11-10,V,"Stadio Ennio Tardini will host Sunday’s football game between Parma and Roma, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the season finale. Parma are fighting hard to avoid relegation to the Serie B, while Roma are eyeing a place in the Champions League. The good news for the hosts is that Gervinho has overcome his injury, but keep in mind that Valenti, Zirkzee, Nicolussi Caviglia, Conti, and Cornelius are sidelined with injuries. 

Kucka, on the other hand, misses the match through suspension. The Giallorossi aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Genoa, and given Parma’s shaky defence, we believe that punters can find value in betting on the capital club. Zaniolo has been tested positive for coronavirus, while Veretout, Dzeko, and Ibanez remain sidelined with injuries. In Dzeko’s absence, Borja Mayoral will continue to lead the line for the visitors.",P
286,Cagliari,Fiorentina,2019-11-10,V,"Sardegna Arena will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Cagliari and Fiorentina, the two teams who sit in the opposite halves of the table. The Rossoblu aim to escape the relegation zone, but they will have a mountain to climb on Matchday 23. The Sardinians failed to impress in a 1-0 loss to Roma, and it is no surprise the bookies see them as underdogs in Sunday’s clash. Both Carboni and Pavoletti are banned for the match, while all Lovato, Oliva, Bellanova, Grassi, and Aresti have been tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Viola, on the other hand, rolled over Genoa 6-0 to keep their Champions League hopes alive. Since Fiorentina top scorer Dusan Vlahovic continues where he left in 2021, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visiting side. Benassi and Martinez Quarta should be the only absentees in the away side. ",P
283,Juventus,Milan,2019-11-10,V,"There will be fireworks when Juventus and Milan face each other in the Serie A derby at Allianz Stadium. Juve continue life without Cristiano Ronaldo, who was sorely missed in the first three games of the season. With only one point in their pocket from possible nine, Massimiliano Allegri’s men sit in the danger zone, but the game against their old rivals could be the turning point for the hosts. Since all Alex Sandro, Bentacur, Cuadrado, Danilo, and Dybala all return from international duties, home win should be considered this time out. 

All Arthur, Chiesa, and Kaio Jorge are sidelined with injuries, while Bernardeschi is a major doubt. The Rossoneri aim to keep their 100% record in the new Serie A campaign intact, but beating Juve at Allianz Stadium is easier said than done. Juventus want this win more than Milan, and that is the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the Bianconeri. Both Bakayoko and Krunic are injured for the visiting team.",V

Sampdoria finished the last Serie A season in 15th place, meaning that they are eager to make amends for the unsuccessful campaign. La Samp produce much better showings at home than on the travels, but they face an uphill task in the season opener. Summer signing is likely to make his official debut against Atalanta. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, missed out on a spot in European competitions last time out, and, no doubt, they are eager to make amends for the unsuccessful domestic campaign. The club chiefs have signed the likes of Ademola Lookman and Ederson in the summer transfer window, and seeing that they managed to keep hold of key players, away win should be considered.

The away side comes into this game winless in any of their last six league matches. The home side meanwhile has lost just once in the previous eight games played. 

Not much can be inferred from the head to head fixture results between the two where-in of the four games have played Lazio have won two while Lecce have won one. These games, however, have generated a whopping 16 goals on an average of 4 goals per game. Lazio are outright favorites to win this game. They are unbeaten and look unbeatable when playing at home. In addition to this, in Ciro Immobile, they have the league's best striker who will once again be the man to watch for the Aquliotti. Taking everything into account, we predict a resounding Lazio win.",V
289,Udinese,SPAL,2019-11-10,N,"Sunday's Serie A matchday 12 game features mid-table Udinese, who host relegation nominees SPAL at the Stadio Friuli. Popular somewhat regular Serie A frontrunners, Udinese, have been uncharacteristically inconsistent and rightly sitting midtable on 12th. Meanwhile, the away side come into this game on the back of a 1-0 loss to AC Milan and with just one victory in seven. Incidentally, both teams have shown an identical vein of poor form. 

In recent history, this fixture has been played five times and generated 12 goals at an average of 2.4 goals per game. SPAL edge the head to head, winning two of the five games to Udinese's one. The Zebrette has been anything but consistent this season, but their 3-1 victory over Genoa last week, should give them enough motivation to go and win this game at home. SPAL have not won an away game this season, and we believe that this will continue against an opposition stronger than them in both quality and mentality. ",V

The Orobici suffered a shocking 2-1 loss to Cagliari at the weekend, meaning that Gianpiero Gasperini should opt to make changes to the starting XI. First-choice goalkeeper Musso is banned for the match, with Rossi likely to step up. All Miranchuk, Ilicic, and Zapata, on the other hand, miss out with injuries. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, did well to beat Verona 2-0 on Dusan Vlahovic’s debut for the Old Lady, and Max Allegri’s troops should take advantage of Atalanta’s absentees as well. Both Federico Chiesa and Giorgio Chiellini remain in the recovery room, while Federico Bernardeschi is a major doubt. Yet another January signing Denis Zakaria should keep his place in the starting XI after finding the net in the triumph over Verona. ",P

The Rossoneri are on a quest to defend their title, and their displays in back-to-back wins over Inter and Sampdoria are certainly giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of upcoming challenges. Rafael Leao serves a one-game ban, while all Ante Rebic, Divock Origi, Alessandro Florenzi, Rade Krunic, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are likely to miss the game with injuries. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to retain top position, but beating Milan on the road is easier said than done. The two teams seem to be evenly matched at the moment, and, taking everything into account, the share of spoils is on the horizon. Both Victor Osimhen and Diego Demme are sidelined through injuries, while Hirving Lozano is a major doubt (virus). ",N

Torino are eager to get back on course, but they will have a mountain to climb in Sunday’s showdown. Pellegri faces race against clock to be fit for the match, while all Fares, Milinkovic-Savic, and Praet are out of contention with injuries. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 5-0 win over Salernitana. Inter are eager to melt Milan’s advantage in the Serie A standings, and they should take advantage of Torino’s anything but good form. Simone Inzaghi has a full squad to choose from, which is yet another reason why away win should be considered. ",P

The Mastini suffered a dip in form, with the team losing to both Atalanta and Torino in the previous two league fixtures. Verona are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but beating the in-form Viola is easier said than done. Both Magnani and Ceccherini are banned for the match, while all Kalinic, Frabotta, and Dawidowicz are out of contention with injuries. 

Following three consecutive league wins, Fiorentina played out a 2-2 draw with Sassuolo at the weekend, with Serbia rising star Dusan Vlahovic scoring his 16th goal of the season. Vlahovic continues to lead the line for the Viola, while Biraghi is banned for the match. Anyhow, a close encounter is on the cards in the “City of Love” as Verona are tough to beat at home.",N

The Romans are eyeing a place in the Champions League, while the newcomers are determined to secure the Serie A survival. Paulo Fonseca’s men head into the match following an unexpected defeated to Parma, and, no doubt, they are determined to start a new winning run in the Italian elite division. 

Even though Paulo Fonseca can’t count on the likes of Zappacosta, Kalinic, and Cristante for the Brescia game, home win should be considered as Roma have turned their Stadio Olimpico into a real fortress. A man to watch in the home team will be Bosnia international Edin Dzeko, while Roma defenders should have Mario Balotelli at bay. Anyhow, Brescia, who suffered a 4-0 loss to Torino on Matchday 12, are unlikely to shock the Giallorossi in the “Eternal City”.",V

The Rossoblu are high on confidence as their head coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has overcome a serious illness. Bologna are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and, one thing is for sure, they are going to dedicate a potential win to the brave Serbian tactician. The good news for the hosts is that Gary Medel returns from suspension. 

Parma, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Napoli, and seeing that they are not regarded as good travellers, we are tempted to put our money on Bologna. In the previous two meetings in the Serie A the two teams shared the spoils, but home win should be considered this time out.

The Zebrette, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team losing each of their previous three league games. Considering that Udinese have been struggling in front of goal of late, we predict that the hosts are going to pick up all three points from Sunday’s showdown. Rodrigo de Paul has been sorely missed in the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign, and seeing that the Zebrette are not regarded as good travelers, home win have to be considered.",V

Both Djuricic and Obiang are out of contention for the hosts, but Alessio Dionisi has no fresh injury worries. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-1 win over Sampdoria, but they will have to do it without suspended midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.

A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Radja Nainggolan, who scored his second goal of the season in the 5-2 win over the Viola. 

Lecce, on the other hand, are on a seven-game winless run in the Serie A. Seeing that the newcomers experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-2 loss at Lazio, we are tempted to put our money on the high-flying visitors.

The Rossoblu suffered a dip in form in the Serie A, and it has to be noted that they were more than fortunate not to suffer a loss to Napoli at Stadio San Paolo on Matchday 12. Genoa are not regarded as good travelers, which is yet another reason why we are going to back SPAL to win Monday’s football match.

Fiorentina have been totally unpredictable in the 2019/2020 season, but they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways in the Serie A. 

Lecce have been struggling at the back of late, with the team failing to win the previous eight league fixtures. The visitors are only one point clear of the relegation zone, and given the importance of the match for the hosts, we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Fiorentina’s party at Stadio Artemio Franchi.

Atalanta are eager to regain their spot in top four, and given Brescia’s current form, we predict that Josip Ilicic and Co. are going to emerge triumphant in Saturday’s football match.

Luciano Spalletti is doing a great job with the league leaders, who are seen as hot favourites to beat the Rossoblu on home soil. 

Defender Amir Rrahmani is sidelined with a groin injury, but Spalletti can count on key players for Sunday’s clash.

Juve are eager to regain Scudetto, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Sassuolo. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, will be without Filip Djuricic in the new Serie A campaign as the Serbia forward joined Sampdoria on a free transfer. Summer signing Agustin Alvarez is likely to make his Sassuolo debut against Juventus, but that is unlikely to help the visitors grab something from the match as Massimiliano Allegri’s men are desperate to make a flying start to the season.

Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat is on international duty with Morocco. ",P
360,SPAL,Brescia,2019-12-08,P,"Despite producing a fine performance against Inter at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, SPAL were eventually beaten by the Nerazzurri on Matchday 14. The Gli Spallini aim to build on the display, and they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways in the Serie A. SPAL play host to Brescia at their Stadio Paolo Mazza on Sunday afternoon, with the team eyeing their fourth home win of the season. 

Le Rondinelle, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level. The newcomers have collected only seven points from possible 39, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling SPAL’s party in Ferrara. As always, a man to watch in the away team will be controversial Italian attacker Mario Balotelli, who has netted two goals in the 2019/2020 Serie A season to date.",V
371,Sampdoria,Parma,2019-12-08,P,"Stadio Luigi Ferraris will host Saturday’s football match between Sampdoria and Parma, the two teams who have nothing to play for on the last day of the season. La Samp missed out on a place in European competitions, but given their display in a 1-0 win over Udinese, it is more than obvious that they want to finish the season in style. Thorsby is banned for the hosts, while both Ramirez and Adrien Silva are sidelined through injuries. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are having a season for forget as they failed to secure the Serie A survival. Given the number of absentees in the away team, we believe that punters can find value in betting on Sampdoria. Kurtic is suspended for the visitors, while all Iacoponi, Man, Caviglia, Pezzella, Osorio, Inglese, Zirkzee, Karamoh, Mihaila, and Cyprien remain in the recovery room. ",V

Summer signing Marko Arnautovic should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while all Schouten, Kingsley, and Bonifazi remain in the recovery room. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are eyeing their fifth consecutive league win. The Stadio San Siro outfit aim to build on a come-from-behind triumph over Verona, but beating Bologna on the road is easier said than done. A close match is on the cards at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara, and we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on draw. All Florenzi, Messias, Plizzari, Hernandez, Diaz, Rebic, and Maignan are out of contention through injuries.",N

The Neapolitans have recorded five wins at home ground so far this term, and they are seen as hot favourites to win Sunday’s football game. Fabian Ruiz has been tested positive for coronavirus, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are eyeing their first league win since November 30, 2020. Parma failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Sampdoria at the weekend, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Napoli’s party at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Roberto D’Aversa can’t count on the likes of Nicolussi Caviglia, Bruno Alves, Osorio, Laurini, Karamoh, Balogh, and Valenti for the Napoli game. ",V

The Rossoblu failed to spoil Juve’s party at Allianz Stadium at the weekend, with the team remaining in the relegation zone. All Cassata, Rovella, Fares, and Caicedo remain in the recovery room, while Criscito, Destro, and Maksimovic are rated doubtful for the game. La Samp, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Lazio. 

Genoa and Sampdoria seem to be evenly matched at the moment, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. Both Damsgaard and Torregrossa are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team. A man to keep an eye on in the away side will be Manolo Gabbiadini, who scored a consolation goal in the loss to Lazio.",N

Mario Balotelli helped le Rondinelle pick up all three points from the match, meaning that Lecce should have him at bay on Matchday 16. Seeign that Brescia are eager to escape the relegation zone in the Serie A standings, we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at the Giallorossi, whose top flight status is in great danger as well. 

Lecce shared the spoils with Genoa at the weekend, with the team coming from two goals behind to grab something from the match. Fabio Liverani’s men did well to beat Fiorentina 1-0 in their last away game in the Italian top flight, but given the importance of the match for le Rondinelle, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts this time out.

The Rossoneri experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-3 loss to Milan, but Zlatan Ibrahimovic once again proved his worth. The Sweden veteran is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts, while all Calabria, Castillejo, Rebic, Maignan, and Plizzari are out of contention through injuries. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, failed to win the previous three league fixtures, and given their shaky defence, we believe that the promotion-chasing hosts are going to emerge triumphant in Sunday’s clash. Both Djuricic and Obiang are sidelined with injuries, whilst Frattesi will have to serve his ban. In their last meeting in the Italian top flight Sassuolo defeated AC Milan, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge.",V

The Bianconeri proved their worth in the Stadio Olimpico clash, with the team keeping their Scudetto hopes alive. Juve are brimming with confidence ahead of the visit of Udinese, and even though Federico Chiesa suffered a serious injury at the weekend, home win should be considered. 

All Alex Sandro, Danilo, and Leonardo Bonucci are sidelined with injuries. The Zebrette, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 6-2 loss to Atalanta, and seeing that Juve have been showing signs of improvement of late, the visitors are unlikely to grab something from the match. Roberto Pereyra is sidelined with a shoulder injury, but he should be the only absentee in the away team. ",V

The Viola aim to extend their winning run to four games, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play. Despite failing to find the net in a 2-1 win at Genoa, Atletico Madrid target Dusan Vlahovic should continue to lead the line for the hosts. Gaetano Castrovilli has joined Lorenzo Venuti and Michele Cerofolini in the recovery room, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, did well to crush Bologna 6-1 at the weekend, with the team overtaking their bitter local rivals Milan in top position. The title holders aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and given their attacking potential, over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered. Both Stefano Sensi and Gabriel Brazao miss out with injuries for the visitors.",P

The Mastini aim to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Milan, and, no doubt, they want to impress in their last home match of the process. Faraoni misses the match through suspension, while all Pandur, Dawidowicz, and Coppola remain on the sidelines with injuries. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, suffered a 1-0 loss to Napoli in their last league fixture. Considering that both sides will go for a victory, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Important midfielder Sasa Lukic returns from suspension, whilst all Buongiorno, Sanabria, Zaza, and Fares continue to miss out with injuries. Singo is banned for the match due to the accumulation of yellow cards.",N

The Giallorossi have been in a promising form of late, and a win over SPAL will see them climb to the Champions League berth in the Serie A table. The Romans are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and you should know that they are after their fourth consecutive triumph at their Stadio Olimpico. 

Speaking of the away team, the Gli Spallini suffered a heart-breaking 1-0 loss to Brescia in the relegation six-pointer, with the team extending their winless run in the league to eight games. SPAL do not seem to be on top of their game ahead of the trip to the “Eternal City”, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Roma’s party at Stadio Olimpico. ",V
389,Bologna,Atalanta,2019-12-15,V,"Bologna and Atalanta go head to head at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in a highly-anticipated Serie A game. The Rossoblu are stuck in the middle of the stable, meaning that they have little to play for in the season finale. Given their anything but good display in a 1-0 loss to Fiorentina, home win should not be considered. Both Bonifazi and Sansone are banned for the match, while the likes of Dominguez, Santander, and Kingsley are out of contention with injuries. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to move closer to the Champions League berth. Atalanta have one game in hand, meaning that a win over Bologna will see them stay in the CL race. Wing-back Zappacosta misses the match through suspension, while centre-forward Zapata remains in the recovery room, speaking of the away side. ",P

The Rossoblu have been showing signs of improvement of late, and they are undefeated in the previous five league fixtures. Cagliari aim to build on a 2-1 win over Torino, but this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. All Baselli, Ceter, Walukiewicz, Nandez, Rog, and Strootman are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Napoli. Maurizio Sarri’s troops are on a three-game unbeaten run on the road, and they are surely capable of holding Cagliari to a draw in Sardinia. Both Cataldi and Lazzari are out of contention with injuries, speaking of the visiting team. In the first half of the season the two teams played out a 2-2 draw.",N

Le Rondinelle aim to escape the relegation zone in the Serie A standings, and we are positive that they will go for a win in the midweek fixture against the Neroverdi. Mario Balotelli failed to find the net in the 3-0 win over Lecce, but the experienced attacker is likely to keep his place up front. 

Anyhow, given Brescia’s splendid form, we predict that they are going to give fans yet another reason for celebration this weekend. Sassuolo, on the other hand, are on a four-game winless run in the Italian elite division, but they did well to share the spoils with Juventus and Milan earlier this month. A close encounter is on the cards at Stadio Mario Rigamonti, but the hosts are closer to winning the match than the visitors.",V
398,Sampdoria,Juventus,2019-12-18,P,"Monday’s football game at Stadio Luigi Ferraris pits together Sampdoria and Juventus, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2022/2023 Serie A campaign. Sampdoria failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Atalanta, and it is no surprise the bookies see them as underdogs in the clash with Juve. One of the men to watch in the home team will be summer signing Filip Djuricic, who is eager to impress on his debut at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, while there are no fresh injury worries in Marco Giampaolo’s side. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to build on a splendid 3-0 win over Sassuolo, and even though their injury list is pretty full, we are tempted to put our money on the title-chasing side. La Samp defenders should have Serbia attacker Dusan Vlahovic at bay as he scored a brace in the season opener, while all Arthur, Di Maria, Pogba, Chiesa, and Rabiot remain in the recovery room.",P

The Viola aim to put an end to their three-game losing run, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against the Giallorossi. Both Odriozola and Castrovilli are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Romans, on the other hand, failed to impress in a goalless draw with Bologna. Since Roma head into the match following the Conference League encounter with Leicester City, tired legs could prove to be a big problem for the visiting side. Fiorentina are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and we predict that the hosts will emerge triumphant in Monday’s showdown. Jose Mourinho can’t count on Armenia star Henrikh Mkhitaryan for the “Artemio Franchi” showdown.",V

The club chiefs failed to keep hold of key attacker Romelu Lukaku in the summer transfer window, but, as things stand now, fellow striker Lautaro Martinez is likely to stay at the club. Summer signings Denzel Dumfries, Hakan Calhanoglu, and Edin Dzeko are all pushing for a start. Aforementioned attacker Lautaro Martinez is banned for the season opener, while both Alexis Sanchez and Roberto Gagliardini remain in the recovery room. 

Christian Eriksen is still recovering from a heart-attack. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, kicked off their Coppa Italia campaign with a 3-2 win over Perugia, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the reigning champions. Both Bani and Benhrami are out of contention through suspensions, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered.",V

The Zebrette have been having their ups and downs of late, with the team beating Sampdoria, sharing the spoils with Roma, while losing to Napoli. Udinese footballers used the international break to clear their heads, and they are surely capable of matching Cagliari on home soil. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, are on a three-game losing run in the Italian top flight. Cagliari failed to find the net in the previous three league fixtures, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. Mari is banned for the hosts, while both Santurro and Perez miss out with injuries. As for the visiting team, the likes of Marin, Nandez, Strootman, Pavoletti, and Gagliano remain in the recovery room.",V
412,Torino,SPAL,2019-12-21,P,"Torino and SPAL will go head-to-head in the last game of Saturday’s Serie A games. The game will be played at the Stadio Olimpico Grande in Torino. The hosts, the Granata, have seen an upturn in their form after a very disappointing start to the season. Walter Mazzari has managed to improve things after their 1-0 loss to Juventus in November. Torino have since won 3 games, drawn 2, and only lost 1 to Inter. 

Belotti is firing again, while the likes of Baselli, Zaza, and Berenguer have been essential for Mazzari. They will play SPAL, who look like the primary candidates for relegation this season. Their form, especially away from home, has been abysmal. They have only collected 9 points and only picked up a single point on the road. Torino will be looking for a win here in a game that could see the SPAL manager Semplici sacked.",V
421,Lecce,Bologna,2019-12-22,P,"The relegation candidates, Lecce, will face Bologna at their Stadio Comunale on Sunday. This is a game that could go either way. Lecce have done quite well this season. They were considered as primary candidates for relegation, but have defied predictions. They are 15th at the moment and are in a mixed run of form. They lost their last game against Brescia 3-0 but managed to beat Fiorentina away from home two games ago. 

At home, they have seen plenty of goals this season, and we can expect the trend to continue here. Bologna are a team with a lot of attacking potential, but a very liable defense. Their away games have produced goals from both sides on all but two occasions. Orsolini, Sansone and Palacio compose a deadly attack, but their defense is not the best. Their away form has been poor, but Lecce are a beatable team. We can see a high-scoring draw here in a game that could go either way.",N

The Neroverdi aim to move closer to the Europa League berth, and we are positive that they will adopt an attack-minded approach in Wednesday’s clash. Both Djuricic and Boga are sidelined with injuries, while Obiang continues to miss out through illness. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, rolled over Lazio 4-0 at the weekend, with the team retaining top position in the standings. Given Napoli’s attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Keep in mind, though, that key attacker Osimhen is injured for the visitors, as well as Ounas and Anguissa. Both Ounas and Politano have been tested positive for coronavirus. ",N

The Orobici kicked off the new domestic campaign in style, with the team beating Sampdoria 2-0 on the road, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry against the title holders. Ademola Lookman, who scored on his Serie A debut, is widely expected to start against Milan, while all Ederson Jose, Merih Demiral, and Davide Zappacosta are out of contention through injuries. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, started their title defence with a 4-2 in over Udinese, and given their attacking potential, we believe that both teams to score betting option should be considered. Both Sandro Tonalli and Zlatan ibrahimovic are injured for the visiting side. In their last meeting in Bergamo Milan recorded a 3-2 win over Atalanta.",N
413,Parma,Brescia,2019-12-22,N,"Parma will host Brescia in their last game of the year. Both teams will be looking to get something from this game; here is our prediction. Parma have an outside chance of Europa League qualification this season. They sit in the 7th spot prior to their game with Brescia, with two straight wins against Napoli and Sampdoria on their account. In fact, they only lost to Milan in their last five games. 

They will undoubtedly be looking for a win against a poor Brescia side, but it won’t be easy. This is because Brescia have seen an upturn in their fortunes recently. Some bizarre things have been happening at the club, which is not surprising for Cellino, who is known as a trigger-happy owner. Eugenio Corini was sacked in November but has been reinstalled as the manager on the 2nd of December. Since then, Le Rondinelle have won two consecutive games against Lecce and SPAL. But Parma are in a better condition than those two teams; therefore, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. ",V

All Maksimovic, Cassata, Sturaro, Buksa, Biraschi, and Vanheusden are out of contention with injuries, while Destro and Criscito will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

Despite producing a fine display against Inter, the Neroverdi were eventually beaten by the Nerazzurri before the international break. Since Sassuolo are eager to return to winning ways, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Midfielder Obiang remains on the sidelines through illness, but he should be the only absentee in the away side. You should bear in mind that 11 goals in total have been netted in the previous three meetings between the two sides.",N

Simone Inzaghi’s men are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Brescia, and we predict that they are going to give fans yet another reason for celebration. 

Both Luis Alberto and Lucas Leiva miss the match through suspension, but in-form attacker Ciro Immobile is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. The newcomers, on the other hand, shared the spoils with Parma in their last league fixture, but that did not help them escape the relegation zone.

Ghana rising star Felix Afena-Gyan is pushing for a start after the 18-year-old scored a brace in the last league match. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, produce much better showings at home than on the travels, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on Jose Mourinho’s troops.

Even though SPAL will be without Reca, Sala, D’alessandro, and Fares (all injured) against Hellas Verona, we predict that they are going to find the net in Sunday’s clash. The Mastini, on the other hand, have been scoring goals for fun in the Italian elite division of late. Following an unlucky 3-2 loss at Atalanta, Hellas Verona played out a 3-3 draw with Torino in their last league fixture.

Atalanta have been showing signs of improvement of late, but seeing that they have yet to find their best form in the new Serie A campaign, we are tempted to put our money on Simone Inzaghi’s troops. Both Muriel and Hateboer remain in the treatment room, but Gian Piero Gasperini has no fresh injury worries. ",V

Defender Wilfried Singo is back from suspension, while all Mandragora, Kone, Verdi, Belotti, and Djidji miss out with injuries. 

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 3-2 loss to Fiorentina. Bologna are eyeing their third consecutive away win in the Serie A, but seeing that key attacker Marko Arnautovic remains in the recovery, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

The Zebrette failed to win the previous eight league fixtures, and, no doubt, they are determined to put an end to the negative trend. Argentina forward Ignacio Pussetto remains in the recovery room, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. Fit-again winger Gerard Deulofeu is pushing for a start. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a shocking 2-1 loss to Empoli. Since Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Lopez is out of contention through suspension, while both Djuricic and Ayhan remain on the sidelines with injuries. In their last meeting in Udine the Zebrette defeated the Neroverdi 2-0.",N

All Felix Afena-Gyan, Amadou Diawara, and Ebrima Darboe are on international duty. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, played out a 1-1 draw with Napoli in the last league match. Max Allegri’s troops are eager to keep their Scudetto hopes alive, and seeing that they are likely to go for a win in Sunday’s derby as well, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Serbia international Darko Lazovic faces race against clock to be fit for the match, while all Dawidowicz, Frabotta, Lasagna, and Pandur are definitely out of contention with injuries. 

Genoa, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Torino before the international break, and they managed to get one. The Rossoblu regained a much-needed confidence, but given their poor away record, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on the home side.

The Viola extended their winless run in the Serie A to eight games, meaning that the hosts are low on spirits ahead of the visit of SPAL. However, they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways in the Italian top flight. 

SPAL sit in the last position in the Serie A table after 18 rounds, with the team recording only one victory in the last eleven games. Leonardo Semplici’s troops do not seem to be competitive at this level, and given Fiorentina’s performance in the 1-1 draw with Bologna, home win should be considered.

La Samp are not having a season to remember, but the game against the fellow relegation-threatened team could be the turning point for the hosts. 

You should bear in mind, though, that attacker Gaston Ramirez is likely to miss the game with injury. In his absence, all eyes will be on experienced striker Fabio Quagliarella. Brescia, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss to Lazio in their last league match, with defender Andrea Cistana being sent off. Since Mario Balotelli and Co. have been struggling to find their form in the Italian elite division of late, home win should be considered.",V

The Gli Emiliani aim to retain their spot in the top half of the Serie A standings, but home win should not be considered as pacey winger Gervinho is sidelined with injury. 

Lecce, on the other hand, are eager to secure the Serie A survival. The newcomers are fighting hard to avoid the drop to the Serie B, and we are positive that they are going to grab something from the Parma game. You should bear in mind that Lecce have already registered three wins on the road in the 2019/2020 Serie A season.

Ciro Immobile, who scored his 27th goal of the season at the weekend, will be the man to watch in the home team, while experienced winger Pedro will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

La Samp, on the other hand, are high on spirits following the Derby della Lanterna triumph. Sampdoria, though, are not regarded as good travelers, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. As for the visitors, there are no fresh injury worries, but both Giovinco and Gabbiadini remain in the recovery room.

Luciano Spalletti’s troops are eager to overtake Milan in top position, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at Fiorentina. 

Zambo Anguissa is banned for the match, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. The Viola, on the other hand, defeated Empoli in the local derby thanks to Nicolas Gonzales’ goal. Fiorentina are enjoying a very successful season, but given their anything but good away record (5-3-7), we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

Sassuolo are eager to return to winning ways, but they will have to do it without Pedro Obiang, who is out of contention through illness. 

Giacomo Raspadori is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 4-0 win over Salernitana where Antonio Sanabria opened his goal-scoring account. Key attcacker Andrea Belotti is sidelined with injury, as well as Djidji, Izzo, Zaza, and Verdi, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. ",V

Samu Castillejo, Franck Kessie, and Alessio Romagnoli have left the club in the summer, but new signings Divock Origi and Charles De Ketelaere should help the title-holders improve their game. 

There are no injury worries in the home team ahead of the season opener. The Zebrette, on the other hand, failed to beat Milan in the previous five meetings between the two sides at Stadio San Siro, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered.

Cristiano Ronaldo returns from injury, but the reigning champions will be without Chiesa and Bernardeschi in the Allianz Stadium showdown. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-3 loss to fellow relegation strugglers Cagliari. The visitors are low on confidence ahead of the trip to Turin, and seeing that CR7 is back, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise.

Genoa have recorded only one win in the new season, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as underdogs in Sunday’s clash.

Marko Arnautovic, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line, while defender Adama Soumaoro will have to serve his one-game ban against Verona. 

Anyhow, we predict that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops will find the net in their first home game of the season as Verona experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 5-2 loss to Napoli. The Mastini do not look sharp defensively, but given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

The Sardinians, on the other hand, suffered a 2-0 loss to Cagliari in their last league match, with the team extending their losing run in the national championship to four games. 

The Rossoblu have been totally out of form of late, which should see Brescia pick up vital three points from Sunday’s showdown. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Mario Balotelli, who is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders.

There are no fresh injury worries in the home team, while summer signing Lameck Banda is likely to make his Serie A debut against Inter. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, are on a quest to regain Scudetto, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the newcomers.

Anyhow, Atalanta’s current form is amazing, and we predict that they are going to extend their winning run at home to four games. 

A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Slovenia international Josip Ilicic, who scored a brace in the triumph over Parma. SPAL, on the other hand, recorded only one win in the last twelve league fixtures.

Aforementioned attacker Rebic, who scored a brace in the victory over the Zebrette, is likely to return to the starting XI against Brescia. 

Le Rondinelle are fighting hard to secure the Serie A survival, but that is easier said than done. Controversial attacker Mario Balotelli is sidelined through suspension, but Milan defenders should have Ernesto Torregrosa at bay as he scored a brace in the 2-2 draw with Cagliari.

Considering that the club chiefs did well to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visiting team. 

New goalkeeper Juan Agustin Musso is likely to make his Serie A debut with Atalanta against Torino. All Toloi, De Roon, and Freuler are banned for the match, while Hateboer and Malinovskyi are sidelined with injuries.

The Rossoneri made a promising start to the season, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to win their first Scudetto since 2011. Florenzi is sidelined with injury, but Ibrahimovic could recover in time to face the Mastini. 

Both Maldini and Calabria are rated doubtful for the game. Verona, on the other hand, did well to crush Spezia 4-0 in their last league match. Considering that Verona have been scoring goals for fun of late, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. In their last meeting at Stadio San Siro the two teams played out a 2-2 draw. Both Ruegg and Frabotta miss out with injuries, while Faraoni and Ilic are major doubts.",V
532,Atalanta,Genoa,2020-02-02,N,"Atalanta will look to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Roma when they welcome Genoa to their Gewiss Stadium on Matchday 29. The Orobici do not want to give up on their Champions League dream, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Rossoblu. Luis Muriel should be recalled to the starting line-up, whilst De Roon is banned for the hosts. Duvan Zapata has yet to recover from a long-term injury. 

Genoa, on the other hand, are seven points behind the safe zone. The Rossoblu have drawn each of their last six league fixtures, but seeing that Atalanta are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the relegation-threatened visitors are unlikely to grab something from the match. Both Rovella and Sturaro are banned for the match, while the likes of Cambiaso, Ekuban, Piccoli, Criscito, Czyborra, and Vanheusden should miss out with injuries.",V
541,Sampdoria,Napoli,2020-02-03,P,"Samdoria and Napoli go head to head at Stadio Luigi Ferraris in what is expected to be an interesting Serie A game. Sampdoria aim to build on a 3-0 win over Empoli, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in the midweek clash. Veteran Fabio Quagliarella should be rested against Napoli, while fellow attacker Francesco Caputo should keep his place up front after scoring a brace in the triumph over Empoli. 

Manolo Gabbiadini should be the only absentee in the home team. The Neapolitans, on the other hand, made a promising start to the season, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on both teams to score. All Demme, Lobotka, and Meret are likely to miss the game with injuries for the visiting team, while Sampdoria defenders should have Lorenzo Insigne at bay.",N
544,Lazio,Hellas Verona,2020-02-05,N,"Lazio will try to recover from a 2-1 defeat to Napoli when they host Verona to their Stadio Olimpico on Matchday 6. The Biancocelesti continue to rely on experienced attacker Ciro Immobile, who has netted two goals this season, and we are positive that the 32-year-old will pose a big threat to the opposition back-line. Keep in mind that midfielder Danilo Cataldi is banned for a blasphemous language. 

Verona, on the other hand, continue with their old habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels. Verona often struggle on the road, but the share of spoils is on the cards this time out as Gabriele Cioffi’s troops are undefeated in the previous three meetings with Lazio in the Eternal City. There are no fresh selection worries in the away side ahead of the trip to Rome. ",N

The Giallorossi continue with their old habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels, and, as a result, the bookies see them as favourites to win Sunday’s clash. The good news for Jose Mourinho is that both Fuzato and Zaniolo are back from suspensions, but Oliveira is banned for the Bologna game. 

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops, on the other hand, have nothing to play for in the remainder of the season as they are stuck in the middle of the table. Given Bologna’s anything but good away record in Serie A, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on the Romans. Kingsley and Dijks should be the only absentees in the away side.",V

Il Toro do not seem to be at the top of their game, with the team losing three of their last four league fixtures. Torino failed to spoil Milan’s party at Stadio San Siro at the weekend, and, no doubt, they are low on spirits ahead of the visit of Sampdoria. 

La Samp, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Atalanta. Despite the midweek defeat, Sampdoria have been in a fine form of late, and they are likely to hold Torino to a draw at Stadio Olimpico di Torino. The good news for the visitors is that Bereszynski returns from suspension, but all Augelio, Damsgaard, Verre, and Vieira are out of contention through injuries. ",N
551,Hellas Verona,Juventus,2020-02-08,V,"After suffering a shocking 2-1 loss to Sassuolo, Juventus will be looking to give fans some cheer when they take on Verona at Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi on Matchday 11. The Bianconeri are 13 points behind league leaders Milan, meaning that this has to go down as a must-win game for Massimiliano Allegri’s troops. Defender De Sciglio, who limped off with injury in the midweek defeat, is likely to drop to the bench, with Alex Sandro stepping up. 

Both Bernardeschi and Kean should miss out as well. The Mastini, on the other hand, came from behind to share the spoils with Udinese in their last league match. Verona have turned their Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi into a real fortress, and given Juve’s poor display in the last league match, home win should be considered. Both Casale and Frabotta are injured for the hosts.",V

The Viola continue life without key attacker Dusan Vlahovic, but his replacement Krzysztof Piatek did well to open his goal-scoring account in a 2-1 win over Spezia. Fiorentina aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and we are positive they will go for a win in Sunday’s clash. Vincenzo Italiano should have a full squad to choose from. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, were on the verge of beating Juventus in Bergamo, but Danilo eventually scored a late equalizer for “The Old Lady”. Since Atalanta are eager to climb to the Champions League berth, we believe that both teams to score betting option should be considered. All Miranchuk, Zapata, and Palomino remain in the recovery room, while Ukraine international Ruslan Malinovsky returns to the starting XI after scoring a wonder goal in the draw with Juve. ",N

The Nerazzurri are leading the chase for Scudetto, but they can’t afford any complacency in the remainder of the season as both Milan and Napoli are breathing down their neck. The likes of Arturo Vidal, Alexis Sanchez, and Lautaro Martinez are unlikely to feature in the local derby as they represented their national teams in the World Cup qualifiers in midweek. 

Both Gosens and Correa are out of contention with injuries. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, head into the match following a goalless draw with Juventus. Milan and Inter seem to be evenly matched ahead of the Giuseppe Meazza showdown, and, taking everything into account, the share of spoils is on the cards. Franck Kessie is unlikely to feature in Saturday’s clash as he is on the verge of leaving the club, while all Ballo-Toure, Kjaer, and Tomori miss out with injuries.",N
561,Napoli,Lecce,2020-02-09,P,"All eyes will be on Stadio Diego Armando Maradona when Napoli and Lecce square off against each other in the Derby of the South. Napoli made a promising start to the season, with the team beating both Verona (5-2) and Monza (4-0), while sharing the spoils with Fiorentina in the last league fixture. Both Adam Ounas and Diego Demme are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. Despite failing to find the net in the last league fixture, Victor Osimhen will continue to lead the line for the hosts. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, have collected only one point in total from the first three league fixtures, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as big underdogs in the midweek clash. Over the years Napoli have turned their Stadio Diego Armando Maradona into a real fortress, and we predict that they will emerge triumphant in Wednesday’s clash. Both Mert Cetin and Kastriot Dermaku are injured for the visiting side.",V
560,Brescia,Udinese,2020-02-09,N,"Despite producing a fine performance against Inter, Udinese failed to grab something from the Dacia Arena showdown. The Zebrette aim to make amends for the 2-0 loss to Antonio Conte’s troops, and they are seen as favourites to win the clash against the relegation strugglers. A man to watch in the away team will be Kevin Lasagna, who made life difficult for Inter defenders at the weekend. 

It has to be noted that Samir (injury) is the only absentee in the away team. The hosts, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss at Bologna in their last league match. Even though controversial attacker Mario Balotelli returns from suspension for the home side, we are tempted to put our money on Udinese, whose showings are much better than their results. Seeing that Brescia defeated Udinese at Dacia Arena in the first half of the season, the visitors must be hungry for revenge.",P

Alexander Blessin’s troops are on a three-game losing run, but this seems like a good opportunity for the hosts to get back on course. All Sturaro, Vanheusden, Cambiaso, and Rovella are sidelined through injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Sassuolo, and they managed to get one thanks to Alessandro Deiola’s goal. Cagliari, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and given the importance of Sunday’s game for Genoa, we predict that the visiting side will return to Sardinia empty-handed. Lovato misses out through suspension, while the likes of Nandez, Goldaniga, Strootman, Obert, and Ceppitelli are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the away team. ",V

The Neroverdi aim to regain their spot in top ten, and we are positive that they will stick to their attacking style of play against SPAL. Leonardo Semplici’s troops did well to beat Atalanta in Bergamo on Matchday 20, but the team then suffered a dip in form, losing to Bologna (1-3), and Lazio (1-5) in the previous two league fixtures. 

The rock-bottom side aim to escape the relegation zone, but the game against Sassuolo will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. Anyhow, both teams to score bet should be considered as both SPAL and Sassuolo are likely to go for a win in the Stadio Paolo Mazza showdown. ",N

Parma’s main goal is to secure the Serie A survival, while Lazio are determined to represent Italy in European competitions for yet another term. The Gli Emiliani are on a four-game losing run in the Serie A, but a win over Lazio could see them escape the relegation zone. 

Since the likes of Iacoponi, Gervinho, Grassi, Caviglia, Kucka, Osorio, and Karamoh are all sidelines with injuries, home win should not be considered. The Biancocelesti proved their worth in a 2-1 win over Fiorentina, and seeing that they aim to move a little closer to the Europa League berth, we are tempted to put our money on the capital club, who will be without Correa and Lulic in Sunday’s showdown.",P

Since they play host the rock-bottom side at their “Via del Mare” on Saturday evening, we believe that punters can find value in betting on Fabio Liverani’s charges. 

The Gli Spallini, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss to Sassuolo in front of home fans at the weekend, with the team extended their losing run in the national championship to three matches.

The capital club aim to return to winning ways as soon as possible, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Nerazzurri in Saturday’s clash. 

There are no fresh injury worries in the home team, with goalkeeper Luis Maximiano returning from suspension. Inter, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-0 win over Spezia.

To make things even worse for the home team, all Nandez, Lovato, Rog, Strootman, Walukiewicz, and Ceter should miss out with injuries. The Partenopei, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Inter. Luciano Spalletti’s troops, though, did well to beat both Bologna and Venezia in the previous two away games, which is probably the main reason why away win should be considered.

Pedro Obiang is banned following his awful tackle on Federico Chiesa, but Sassuolo boss Roberto De Zerbi has a number of high-profile footballers to choose from. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are running down a blind alley at the moment, with the team losing each of their previous five league fixtures. Since Parma conceded 14 goals in total in the previous five league fixtures, anything but a routine home win would be a big surprise. Gervinho has overcome his injury, but Lautaro Valenti, who was forced to leave the field in the first half of the match against Lazio, is unlikely to feature against Sassuolo.",V

Even though all Ibrahimovic, Florenci, Bennacer, Castillejo, Kjaer, Rebic, and Romagnoli are sidelined with injuries, home win should be considered as Genoa are not regarded as good travellers. 

The Rossoblu have collected only 11 points on the road from possible 48, and given their shaky defence, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise. All Bani, Vanheusden, Rovella, and Cambiaso remain in the recovery room, while fit-again defender Domenico Criscito is pushing for a start after coming as a substitute in a 4-1 loss to Lazio. ",V

Portugal forward Beto, who found the net in the triumph over the Biancorossi, will be the man to watch in the home team, while defender Leonardo Buta misses out with injury. 

The Viola, on the other hand, head into the midweek game following back-to-back draws with Empoli and Napoli. Fiorentina have been impressive at the back of late, and seeing that Udinese are tough to beat at home, we are tempted to put our money on under 2.5 goals.

All Depaoli, Vieira, and Damsgaard are out of contention with injuries, while Yoshida is a major doubt. You should know that Claudio Ranieri’s troops are eyeing their only second home win of the season. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, showed character in their last league match, with the team beating Empoli thanks to Adrien Tameze’s late goal. Verona are high on confidence ahead of the trip to Genoa, and they are surely capable of holding Sampdoria to a draw. Both Kalinic and Bessa are back from suspension for the visiting team. ",N

Mario Balotelli and Co. are likely to leave their hearts on the field against Sassuolo, but we do not believe that they are capable of picking up all three points from the match. 

Considering that the Neroverdi failed to impress in a 1-0 home loss to Parma, share of spoils is on the horizon. It has to be noted that Sassuolo boss Roberto de Zerbi has a full squad to choose from. As for the away team, defender Ales Mateju misses the game through suspension.

Parma, on the other hand, failed to secure the Serie A survival, meaning that they are low on spirits ahead of the trip to Turin. Given the number of absentees in the away team, are positive that Roberto D’Aversa’s men are going to return home empty-handed.

Sassuolo, on the other hand, produced a fine display against Inter at the weekend, but the Nerazzurri eventually picked up all three points from the match thanks to Edin Dzeko’s goal. Sassuolo, though, are not regarded as good travellers, and we do not believe that they are capable of upsetting Atalanta in Bergamo.

Donati is suspended for the Milan game, while Deiola, Farias, Dell’orco and Barak are all out of contention with injury. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are eyeing a place in the Europa League. Milan have been having their ups and downs in the second half of the season, but given Lecce’s shaky defence, away win should be considered.

A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Joao Pedro, who scored a brace in the defeat to the Giallorossi. The good news for the hosts is that Nandez served his ban against Roma. SPAL have slim chances of avoiding relegation to the Serie B, but they should take advantage of the fact that Cagliari head into the match with a severely weakened squad.

The GIallorossi will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways, but keep in mind that defender Fabio Lucioni is sidelined through suspension. 

La Samp, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 2-1 loss to Bologna. Claudio Ranieri’s troops aim to put an end to their three-game losing run in the Serie A, and they are likely to adopt an attack-minded approach in Wednesday’s clash as well. Even though experienced attacker Fabio Quagliarella remains in the recovery room, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.",N
705,Inter,Brescia,2020-07-01,V,"Thanks to a come-from-behind win over Parma, Inter revived their Scudetto hopes. The Nerazzurri are eight points behind league leaders Juventus ahead of Matchday 29, meaning that they have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Brescia. Antonio Conte’s troops regained a much-needed confidence at the weekend, and they should not find it hard to beat the relegation strugglers at home. 

Milan Skriniar returns from suspension for the Nerazzurri, but Marcelo Brozovic remains in the recovery room. Brescia, on the other hand, picked up only one point from the relegation six-pointer against Genoa. Le Rondinelle have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival, and given the importance of the match for Inter, home win should be considered. The likes of Jhon Chancellor, Andrea Cistana, and Dimitri Bisoli are all likely to miss the midweek clash with injury. ",V
711,SPAL,Milan,2020-07-01,N,"Milan will be aiming to build on a 2-0 win over Roma when they take on SPAL at Stadio Paolo Mazza on Wednesday evening. The Rossoneri aim to move a little closer to the Europa League berth, and, no doubt, they will go for a win in the midweek fixture. Milan have been producing fine performances in the Serie A of late, and, no doubt, they are high on confidence ahead of the trip to Ferrara. 

Centre-back Simon Kjaer has overcome his injury, meaning that boss Stefano Pioli is going to field the best possible side against SPAL. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, though, remains in the treatment room. The hosts, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the standings, with the team collecting only 18 points from possible 84. The rock-bottom side have little to play for in the season finale, and given the importance of the match for Milan, away win should be considered. ",P

The Orobici recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Bologna before the international break, with the team climbing to the Conference League berth. Atalanta have slim chances of securing a top-four finish, but they could still book a spot in the Europa League. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-1 win over Udinese. Luciano Spalletti’s troops are only three points behind league leaders Milan, and they will give their best to melt the Rossoneri’s advantage. However, beating Atalanta in Bergamo is easier said than done. A close encounter is on the cards at Gewiss Stadium, and we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on draw. Both Rrahmani and Osimhen are banned for the match, while Meret, Petagna, and Di Lorenzo remain in the recovery room.",N

Following three consecutive wins, the Romans suffered a 3-2 loss to Verona in the “City of Love” at the weekend. The Giallorossi aim to return to winning ways as soon as possible, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at Udinese. Leonardo Spinazzola should be the only absentee in the home team. 

Henrikh Mkhitaryan is widely expected to return to the starting XI. The Zebrette, on the other hand, suffered four defeats in the previous five meetings with Roma in the Serie A. Since Udinese are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on Jose Mourinho’s troops this time out. Talented defender Iyenoma Udogie remains on the sidelines with injury for the visiting team. ",V

The Neroverdi continue life without Filip Djuricic and Gianluca Scamacca, who left the club earlier this summer, but the likes of Defrel and Berardi are surely capable of making life difficult for the opposition back-line. Midfielder Maxime Lopez is back from suspension, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, were more than unfortunate not to hold Inter to a draw in their opener, with the Nerazzurri scoring the winner in the stoppage time. Lecce are not regarded as good travellers, and seeing that Sassuolo are eager to make amends for the defeat to Juve, home win should be considered. Defensive duo Alessandro Tuia – Kastriot Dermaku remains in the recovery room, speaking of the visiting side.",V

A man to watch in the home team will be Ciro Immobile, who scored a late equalizer at the weekend, while Pedro faces race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s clash. 

Patric, who limped off with injury against Il Toro, is definitely out of contention. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, recorded a routine 2-0 win over Genoa to retain top position in the standings. The league leaders, though, will have a much bigger fish to fry in the “Eternal City”, and we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on draw. All Ibrahimovic, Florenzi, Kjaer, and Castillejo should miss out with injuries, while both Gabbia and Romagnoli are major doubts. ",N

The Bianconeri are determined to book their place in the Champions League for yet another term, and, no doubt, big-money signing Dusan Vlahovic is capable of helping “The Old Lady” meet the goal. 

Danilo, who scored a late equalizer against the Orobici, misses out through suspension, while both Chiellini and Chiesa remain in the recovery room. Torino, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form, and seeing that they failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Udinese and Venezia, we are tempted to put our money on Juve. Both Fares and Praet are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team ahead of the local derby.",V
730,Udinese,Genoa,2020-07-05,N,"After suffering a 2-1 loss to Torino on Monday, Udinese will be looking to escape the danger zone when they take on Genoa on Matchday 14. The Zebrette continue with their habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels, and they are surely capable of matching the Rossoblu in front of home fans. Since midfielder Jean-Victor Makengo returns from suspension, Luca Gotti should have a full squad to choose from. 

Genoa, on the other hand, suffered a 2-0 loss to Roma in their last league match, with the team remaining in the relegation zone. Since the Rossoblu are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on Luca Gotti’s troops. Genoa’s injury list is pretty long as all Destro, Kallon, Fares, Caicedo, Criscito, Maksimovic, and Cassata missing out with injuries. ",V

Cagliari’s main goal is to avoid relegation, while Atalanta are eyeing yet another participation in the Champions League. The Sardinians are on a three-game losing run in the Italian top flight, and given their shaky defence, home win should be considered. 

Caceres is sidelined through suspension, while all Ceter, Rog, Dalbert, and Walukiewicz are likely to miss the game with injuries. Keita is a major doubt. The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to regain their spot in top four, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play. Since Atalanta have been impressive on the road this season, we predict that Josip Ilicic and Co. are going to pick up all three points from the match. All Djimsiti, Gosens, Hateboer, Toloi, and Pessina remain in the recovery room. ",P

Parma did well to hold Inter to a 2-2 draw at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, but they need to keep on improving their game if they are to move away from the danger zone. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be experienced attacker Gervinho, who scored a brace in the draw with Inter. 

Keep in mind that the Gli Emiliani are eyeing their second home win of the season. The Viola, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss at Roma. Fiorentina have been having their ups and downs at the start of the season, but given Parma’s shaky defence, the visitors are surely capable of finding the net in the Stadio Ennio Tardini clash.

Cameroon international Anguissa is back from suspension, while all Di Lorenzo, Malcuit, Ounas, and Petagna have been struggling with injuries of late. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, came from behind to beat rock-bottom Salernitana at the weekend. Since Jose Mourinho’s troops will go for a win as well, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Lorenzo Pellegrini served his one-game ban against Salernitana, while Leonardo Spinazzola has overcome his long-term injury. ",N

Diego Lopez’s men are eyeing their first league win since December 14, 2019, but given their shaky defence, we do not believe that they are capable of making life difficult for Hellas Verona. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, proved their worth in a 3-2 win over Parma, with the team keeping their Europa League hopes alive. Verona are more of a team than Brescia, and seeing that Sunday’s game will be played behind closed doors, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Ivan Juric’s troops.

The triumph gave La Samp a confidence boost, but they need to keep on raising their form if they are to secure the elite division survival. Gaston Ramirez, who scored a brace from the penalty spot against Lecce, will be the man to watch in the home team. 

SPAL, on the other hand, dropped a two-goal advantage in a 2-2 draw with AC Milan. The relegation strugglers missed a good chance to get back on course, and, no doubt, the lack of confidence is likely to prove to be a big problem for the visitors in Sunday’s showdown. SPAL midfielder Marco D’Alessandro is sidelined through suspension, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. ",V

Since Romelu Lukaku returned to Chelsea in the summer transfer window, fellow attacker Lautaro Martinez will be the man to watch in the home team, while midfielder Sensi should be the only absentee for the hosts. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops did well to beat Verona thanks to Mattias Svanberg’s goal, but given their anything but good away record in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

Keep in mind, though, that the home team’s injury list is pretty long, including the likes of Simon Kjaer, Davide Calabria, Alexis Saelemaekers, Junior Messias, Mike Maignan, Theo Hernandez, Alessandro Florenzi, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

Juve, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-0 win over Bologna where Serbian duo Filip Kostic – Dusan Vlahovic got their names on the scoresheet. The Bianconeri want to keep on climbing the standings, and seeing that they will go for a victory in the Serie A derby as well, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

The duo returns to the starting XI against Lecce, and it is no wonder the capital club are seen as hot favourites to win the midweek fixture. 

To make things even better for the visitors, experienced midfielder Lucas Leiva has overcome his injury. The Giallorossi, on the other hand, suffered a 4-2 loss at Sassuolo, with the team extending their losing run in the Serie A to six games.

800,Sampdoria,Cagliari,2020-07-15,V,"Stadio Luigi Ferraris will host Thursday’s Serie A game between Sampdoria and Cagliari, the two bottom-table sides. La Samp are undefeated in the previous three league fixtures, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of the visit of Cagliari. Veteran striker Fabio Quagliarella has lost his place in the starting XI, while both Falcone and Augello have been tested positive for coronavirus. 

The likes of Damsgaard and Ekdal are sidelined with injuries, while Askildsen misses out through suspension. The Sardinians, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form, with the team losing each of their last three league fixtures. Since Cagliari are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on the home side. Dalbert is banned for the visitors, while all Walukiewicz, Nandez, Rog, and Strootman miss out through different reasons. ",V
795,Sassuolo,Juventus,2020-07-15,N,"Monday’s football game between Sassuolo and Juventus will bring down the curtain on the Serie A round 34. Sassuolo aim to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Cagliari, but they will have a big fish to fry against Juve. Right-back Jeremy Toljan, who limped off with injury at the weekend, is a major doubt, as well as key player Domenico Berardi. Both Harroui and Obiang remain in the treatment room. 

Anyhow, the fact that the Neroverdi defeated Atalanta in their last home fixture is surely giving fans a reason for optimism. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 1-1 draw with Bologna, which is probably the main reason why we are going to put our money on draw. As for the away side, all McKennie, Chiesa, Locatelli, and Kaio Jorge remain on the sidelines with injuries.",N

The Rossoblu have been having their ups and downs in the 2021/2022 season, and, as a result, they sit in the middle of the standings. Home win, though, should not be considered, as Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are hit by coronavirus. 

All Dominguez, Hickey, Medel, Molla, Santander, Vignato, Viola, and van Hooijdonk have been tested positive for coronavirus, while Barrow represents Gambia at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The Partenopei, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Sampdoria, and given the number of absentees in the home side, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors. All Anguissa, Ounas, and Koulibaly are on international duty, while Lozano, Rui, and Zielinski should miss out through illness.",P

The Rossoneri made a flying start to the season, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to put an end to Juventus’ dominance in the Italian top flight. Even though Zlatan Ibrahimovic is unlikely to recover in time to face Parma, the league leaders are seen as hot favourites to win the match. 

Samu Castillejo, who scored as a substitute in the 2-1 win over Sampdoria, is pushing for a start, as well as talented Norway attacker Hauge. The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, failed to impress in a goalless draw with Benevento, and, no doubt, they face an uphill task in the Stadio San Siro clash. It has to be noted that Milan emerged triumphant in each of the previous three meetings between the two clubs at the venue.",V

The Zebrette are determined to move away from the danger zone, but their display in a 4-0 loss to Verona is not giving fans a reason for optimism. Gabriele Cioffi should opt to make changes to the starting XI, with both Arslan and Beto pushing for a start. The likes of Nuytinck and Udogie are rated doubtful for the game, and the duo will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Fiorentina and Bologna. Lazio are eager to keep their Champions League hopes alive, and they should take advantage of Udinese’s shaky defence. Both Lucas Leiva and Luis Alberto are banned for the match, while Lazzari and Acerbi should miss out with injuries.

Mancini misses out through suspension, while both Ibanez and Spinazzola are sidelined with injuries. Experienced forward El Shaarawy is a major doubt. You should bear in mind that Jose Mourinho’s troops are eyeing their eighth home win of the process. 

Verona, on the other hand, continue with their habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels, and given their anything but good away record in the 2021/2022 season (3-4-5), we are tempted to put our money on the capital club.

Since important midfielder Morten Hjumland misses the match through suspension, we are not tempted to put our money on the home side. 

The Viola, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 4-0 loss to Lazio where they failed to turn their dominance into goals. Fiorentina defeated Lecce in each of their last two meetings at Stadio Via del Mare, which is probably the main reason why away triumph should be considered. Forward Riccardo Sottil is sidelined through injury, while midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli should recover in time to face Lecce. ",P

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, aim to escape the relegation zone. 

Genoa head into the match following a 2-2 draw with Sassuolo, and they are eager to put an end to their five-game winless run in the Italian top flight. Genoa, though, are not regarded as good travelers, which is the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

Ante Rebic will continue to lead the line for the hosts, while Rade Krunic is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the match. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are eyeing their first win of the season, but given their anything but good record at San Siro, home triumph should be considered. Milan defeated Bologna in five of their last six meetings in Milano; therefore, we predict that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are going to return home empty-handed.

Midfielder Alberto Grassi returns from suspension, while all Goldaniga, Ceppitelli, Nandez, and Strootman are likely to miss the game with injuries. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, did well to beat Atalanta on Matchday 32 to climb to 9th place in the standings. Sassuolo aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

The Orobici, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Milan. Given Atalanta’s attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on both teams to score. You should know that both sides managed to find the net in each of their previous two meetings in the Italian top flight.

Brescia are on a three-game losing run in the Serie A, and given their position in the standings, this has to go down as a must-win match for the hosts. Ernesto Torregrossa, who scored his sixth goal of the season against Atalanta, will be one of the men to watch in the home team. 

SPAL, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the table, meaning that they are eager to pick up all three points from Sunday’s clash as well. Considering that both sides will go for a win in the relegation six-pointer, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

La Samp aim to build on a 2-1 win over Sampdoria, but given their anything but good away record in the Italian top flight, we are tempted to put our money on draw. 

The likes of Valenti, Bruno Alves, Laurini, Caviglia, Osorio, Karamoh, and Balogh are all out of contention for the hosts. As for the away team, boss Claudio Ranieri can’t count on Ferrari and Gabbiadini, who are both sidelined with injuries. In their last meeting in the Serie A Sampdoria defeated Parma 3-2.",N

The Giallorossi experienced all sorts of problems at the back in the midweek clash, but they are still capable of avoiding relegation to the Seire B. Lecce have no other choice but to stick to their attacking style of play against Genoa, and we are positive that they will find the net in the relegation six-pointer. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are a real force to be reckoned with at home, with the team managing to score in each of their last eight home fixtures. Seeing that 17 goals in total have been netted in the last four meetings between the two teams in all competitions, we are tempted to put our money on over 2.5 goals. ",N

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, are on a three-game winning run in the Italian top flight. Inter faced no difficulties in a 2-0 win over Spezia, with the team remaining in the title race.

All Meret, Malcuit, and Petagna are out of contention with injuries, while Juan Jesus is a major doubt. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, are undefeated in the previous four league fixtures. Udinese have been in a fine form of late, but seeing that Napoli do not suit them, home win should be considered.

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a shocking 2-1 loss to Genoa. Juventus are a real force to be reckoned with at home, which is probably the main reason why we are going to put our money on Dusan Vlahovic and Co.

Bologna, on the other hand, came from behind to beat newcomers Salernitana 3-2 at home ground, with summer signing Marko Arnautovic opening his goal-scoring account.

Both Hamed Junior Traore and Mert Muldur are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-0 win over Bologna.

Conti is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Rossoblu are fighting hard to secure the Serie A survival as well. Genoa desperately needed a win against Cagliari, and they managed to get one thanks to Milan Badelj’s late goal.

Simone Inzaghi should opt to make changes to the starting XI, with both Correa and Vidal pushing for a start, while De Vrij misses the match with injury. 

Brozovic is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. The Viola, on the other hand, defeated ten-man Bologna thanks to Torreira’s goal.

The Romans, on the other hand, were on the verge of beating Inter at Stadio Olimpico, but the Nerazzurri eventually scored a late equalizer to save one point.

Brescia have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Lecce’s party at Stadio Via del Mare.

Considering that the club chiefs managed to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, away win should be considered. 

Both Arthur and Rabiot are sidelined with injuries, while McKennie, who signed a permanent deal with the club, is out of contention through suspension. The Zebrette, on the other hand, have always been struggling in matches against Juve, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp on Matchday 1.

The Mastini produced a fine display at Stadio San Siro at the weekend, but Milan eventually scored three goals in the second half to claim the victory. Verona are eager to get back on course as soon as possible, but, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from Sunday’s clash as well. 

Frabotta is out of contention through injury, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, head into the match with a severely-weakened squad as both Acerbi and Luiz Felipe are banned for the match. Since Lazio are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. As always, Ciro Immobile will lead the line for the visitors.",N

The Giallorossi did well to crush Raja Casablanca 5-0 in their last warm-up game, and they are likely to adopt yet another attacking style of play. This game comes too early for big-money signing Tammy Abraham, but fellow new recruit Eldor Shomurodov should lead the line for the hosts. 

Edin Dzeko is no longer part of the team, while Spinazzola remains in the recovery room after suffering an injury at the EURO 2020 finals. The Viola, on the other hand, should be without key attacker Dusan Vlahovic in Sunday’s clash as the Serbian rising star is on the verge of leaving the club. Since Fiorentina are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Jose Mourinho’s troops. Nordin Amrabat is injured for the visiting team.",V

The Zebrette, on the other hand, head into the game following a 1-1 draw with Milan. 

Udinese have been struggling at the back of late, and seeing that they conceded eight goals in total in the previous three league fixtures, we are tempted to put our money on Cagliari. Former Watford attacker Isaac Success is banned for the visitors, while Pereyra misses out through injury.

Inter are eager to melt Napoli’s advantage in the Serie A standings, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against Napoli. 

Both Alessandro Bastoni and Edin Dzeko face race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s clash, while Stefan de Vrij remains in the recovery room. Napoli, on the other hand, aim to retain top position in the standings, but given their anything but good display in a 1-1 draw with Verona, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the Nerazzurri.

Atalanta goalkeeper Gollini, who was sent off in the 1-1 draw with Sassuolo, is banned for the match, but he should be the only absentee in the away side. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, failed to secure the Serie A survival, meaning that they head into Sunday’s clash with the lack of motivation. Anyhow, Atalanta are more of a team than Parma, and we predict that the favourites are going to prove their worth on the field. Hernani is banned for the hosts, while Man, Burgman, Mihaila, Inglese, Zirkzee, Cyprien, Karamoh, Conti, Caviglia, and Iacoponi are all out of contention through injuries.",P

The likes of Locatelli, Chiesa, Mckennie, and Kaio Jorge are sidelined with injuries. The Sardinians, on the other hand, are fighting hard to survive in the Italian top flight. Cagliari, though, are on a four-game losing run, which is probably the main reason why away win should be considered.

Simone Inzaghi’s troops are eyeing a top-two finish, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Brescia. 

A man to watch in the home team will be Ciro Immobile, who scored a hat-trick against the Mastini. The visitors, on the other hand, are having a season to forget as they failed to secure the Serie A survival. Brescia are low on spirits ahead of the trip to Rome, and they are unlikely to spoil Lazio’s party at an empty Stadio Olimpico.

Obiang and Matheus Henrique are out of contention for the hosts, while Serbia international Filip Djuricic faces race against clock to be fit for the match. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, played out a goalless draw with Atalanta in their last league fixture.

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are high on confidence following a 3-2 win over their local rivals Milan. The title holders aim to overtake Atalanta in top position, and we predict that they will take advantage of Sampdoria’s slow start to the season.

Lecce, on the other hand, have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival as they are four points behind the “safe zone” ahead of the trip to Udine. 

The Giallorossi have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Udinese, meaning that the hosts will have a number of opportunities to score on the break. Even though the visitors want this win more than the hosts, we are tempted to put our money on the in-form Zebrette.

All Fares, Buongiorno, Singo, Sanabria, Zaza, and Bremer are out of contention with injuries.

All Di Maria, Arthur, Pogba, and Chiesa remain in the recovery room, and, in their absences, a man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Dusan Vlahovic. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Salernitana and Cremonese. Jose Mourinho has a number of high-profile players to choose from as the club chiefs reinforced the club in the summer transfer window, and given Juve’s attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

In Ibrahimovic’s absence, summer signing Olivier Giroud is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts. The Sardinians, on the other hand, often struggle on the road, and we do not believe that they are capable of grabbing something from the match.

The Mastini aim to escape the danger zone, but their displays in back-to-back defeats to Lazio (0-2) and Fiorentina (0-2) are not giving fans a reason for optimism. There are no fresh injury worries in the home team, but experienced midfielder Miguel Veloso could sneak into the starting XI. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, have been performing above expectations in the 2022/2023 season, with the team extending their winning run to five games against title-chasing Inter. Since the visitors are high on confidence ahead of the trip to the “City of Love”, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the away side.

Salvador Ferrer is a major doubt, while both Kelvin Amian Adou and Janis Antiste are out of contention with injuries. 

Sassuolo, on the other hand, quickly bounced back from a 3-0 loss to Juve, with the team beating Lecce thanks to Domenico Berardi’s goal. The Neroverdi aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and seeing that Spezia experienced all sorts of problems at the back, away win should be considered.

The Rossoblu are high on confidence as their head coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has overcome a serious illness. Bologna are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and, one thing is for sure, they are going to dedicate a potential win to the brave Serbian tactician. The good news for the hosts is that Gary Medel returns from suspension. 

Parma, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Napoli, and seeing that they are not regarded as good travellers, we are tempted to put our money on Bologna. In the previous two meetings in the Serie A the two teams shared the spoils, but home win should be considered this time out.

Seeing that Matias Vecino is the only absentee in the away team, we believe that punters can find value in betting on the title-chasing side. 

As always, a man to watch in the away team will be Romelu Lukaku, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend. The Gli Stregoni, on the other hand, did well to come from two goals behind and beat Sampdoria on the road. The Yellow and Reds are brimming with confidence ahead of the visit of Inter, but seeing that the game will be played behind closed doors, away win should be considered.",P

Bram Nuytinck is pushing for a start, while Rodrigo Becao misses out through suspension. 

Both Santurro and Success remain in the recovery room, whereas Beto is a major doubt. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, are only three points clear of bottom three ahead of the trip to Udine.

Cataldi misses out through suspension, while all Pedro, Basic, Acerbi, and Radu remain in the recovery room. A man to watch in the home team will be Ciro Immobile, who scored a brace at the weekend. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, did well to hold league leaders Inter to a goalless draw. Atalanta are eager to stay in the Champions League berth, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on both teams to score.

Roberto D’Aversa’s troops, on the other hand, came from behind to beat Verona 3-1 in their last league match. The bad news for the visitors, though, is that defender Alex Ferrari limped off with injury at the weekend.

Experienced attacker Francesco Caputo, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend, is likely to lead the line for the hosts, while Magnanelli, Romero, and Romagna should miss the game with injury. 

Crotone, on the other hand, aim to make amends for back-to-back defeats to Milan and Genoa. The Rossoblu do not seem to be competitive at this level at the start of the season, and given Sassuolo’s attacking potential, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise.

The Mastini, on the other hand, kicked off the new Serie A campaign in the best way possible, with the team outplaying Roma and Udinese without conceding. Verona aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and they are surely capable of spoiling Parma’s party at an empty Stadio Ennio Tardini.

The newcomers are tough to beat at home, but the match against Bologna will be anything but a walk in the park for them. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, welcome Dutch defender Mitchell Dijks back to the starting line-up after he served his ban against Parma. Bologna are not regarded as good travellers, but share of spoils is on the cards at Stadio Ciro Vigorito as the match will be played behind closed doors.

All Kessie, Bennacer, and Ballo-Toure are on international duty, while all Castillejo, Calabria, and Romagnoli are rated doubtful for the game after the trio was tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Genoa. Spezia have been producing fine displays on the road of late, but Milan will pose a much bigger threat for the visiting side than their previous rivals.

Keep in mind, though, that all Malinovskiy, Muriel, Pasalic, and Koopmeiners have been tested positive for coronavirus. 

Both Josip Ilicic and Duvan Zapata are rated doubtful for the game, while Alexey Miranchuk remains in the recovery room.

Both Gosens and Correa are out of contention with injuries. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, head into the match following a goalless draw with Juventus. Milan and Inter seem to be evenly matched ahead of the Giuseppe Meazza showdown, and, taking everything into account, the share of spoils is on the cards.

The bad news for the hosts, though, is that key defender Kalidou Koulibaly suffered an injury in the midweek draw. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, rolled over Venezia 4-0 in their last league match. Atalanta are on a four-game winning run in the Italian top flight, and given their attacking potential, we believe that over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered.

Adrien Rabiot is banned for the Crotone game, while talented defender De Ligt remains in the recovery room for the visitors. 

The hosts, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level at the start of the season. Crotone have already conceded ten goals in the process, and even though Cristiano Ronaldo was tested positive for coronavirus, we do not believe that the underdogs are capable of claiming a major scalp on Matchday 4.

Bologna aim to move closer to the Europa League berth, and they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. Key attacker Marko Arnautovic is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the table. Cagliari failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Fiorentina (0-3) and Roma (1-2), and seeing that Bologna are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the visitors are likely to return to Sardinia empty-handed. All Rog, Strootman, Dalbert, Godin, Ceter, Nandez, and Caceres have been struggling with injuries of late for the visiting side.",V

The likes of Skriniar, Cagliardini, and Radu have all been tested positive for coronavirus, but Antonio Conte can count on key players for the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza showdown. 

Parma, on the other hand, have been struggling at the back of late, with the team conceding five goals in total in the previous two league fixtures. Considering that Inter are determined to put an end to Juve’s dominance in the Serie A, home win should definitely be considered. The likes of Inglese, Busi, Sprocati, Osorio, Mihaila, Scozzarella, Brunetta, and Valenti have all been struggling with injuries for the visiting team.",V

The Zebrette are on a four-game winless run in the national championship, with the team experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 loss to Empoli. Since Udinese have recorded no more than two wins at home ground this term, we are not tempted to put our money on the underdogs. Samir is banned for the hosts, while both Rodrigo Becao and Pereyra are sidelined with injuries. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, aim to retain top position in the Serie A standings. Stefano Pioli’s troops have been in a fine form of late, and even though their injury list is pretty long, away win should be considered. All Calabria, Kjaer, Castillejo, Giroud, Pellegri, Rafael Leao, Rebic, and Plizzari are injured for the away team.",P

The Giallorossi did well to crush Raja Casablanca 5-0 in their last warm-up game, and they are likely to adopt yet another attacking style of play. This game comes too early for big-money signing Tammy Abraham, but fellow new recruit Eldor Shomurodov should lead the line for the hosts. 

Edin Dzeko is no longer part of the team, while Spinazzola remains in the recovery room after suffering an injury at the EURO 2020 finals. The Viola, on the other hand, should be without key attacker Dusan Vlahovic in Sunday’s clash as the Serbian rising star is on the verge of leaving the club. Since Fiorentina are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Jose Mourinho’s troops. Nordin Amrabat is injured for the visiting team.",V

Poland international Piotr Zielinski is widely expected to return to the starting XI, while all Di Lorenzo, Elmas, and Lobotka remain in the recovery room. Ghoulam is a major doubt. 

Sassuolo, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Cagliari and Juventus, and seeing that they head into the season finale with the lack of motivation, home win should be considered. As for the visitors, both Toljan and Harroui are sidelined with injuries, while Obiang remains in the treatment room with heart problems. ",V

Talented attacker Moise Kean could sneak into the starting XI, while all Arthur, Kaio Jorge, and Nicolussi Caviglia are sidelined with injuries. 

Spezia, on the other hand, climbed to 13th position in the standings thanks to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Venezia. Thiago Motta’s troops aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but seeing that the visitors want this win more than the hosts, we predict that Juve will pick up all three points from the match.

Marco Giampaolo can’t count on injured duo Giovinco – Gabbiadini for the local derby, while Rincon misses out due to accumulation of yellow cards. Conti is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Rossoblu are fighting hard to secure the Serie A survival as well. Genoa desperately needed a win against Cagliari, and they managed to get one thanks to Milan Badelj’s late goal. Anyhow, a close encounter is on the cards at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris, and we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

Summer signing Aleksey Miranchuk, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend, will be the man to watch in the home team, while both Mergim Vojvoda and David Zima remain in the recovery room. Armando Izzo is a major doubt. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, recorded a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Bologna in the opening match of the season, and given their attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

The likes of Benassi and Cetin remain in the recovery room for the hosts, while Veloso, Di Carmine, and Danzi are rated doubtful for the game. The Gli Stregoni, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from back-to-back defeats to Roma and Napoli, but seeing that Verona are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we predict that the visitors are going to return to Campania empty-handed from the trip to the “City of Love”.

Il Toro, on the other hand, are stuck in the middle of the table with 35 points in their pocket.

The Zebrette, on the other hand, look unstoppable at the moment, with the team extending their winning run to three games against Roma. Since Udinese crushed Jose Mourinho’s troops 4-0 at the weekend, they are surely capable of holding Sassuolo to a draw at Mapei Stadium – Citta del Tricolore.

The Red and Yellows will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways as they play host to Spezia at their Stadio Ciro Vigorito. 

The visitors experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Juventus, and given the importance of the match for Benevento, we predict that the hosts are going to pick up all three points from the game. Caprari is banned for the hosts, while both Iago Falque and Barba are likely to miss the match with injury.

Keep in mind that the Gli Emiliani are eyeing their second home win of the season. The Viola, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss at Roma. Fiorentina have been having their ups and downs at the start of the season, but given Parma’s shaky defence, the visitors are surely capable of finding the net in the Stadio Ennio Tardini clash.

Keep in mind, though, that all Rog, Ceppitelli, Ceter, and Walukiewicz are sidelined with injuries for the home team. 

La Samp, on the other hand, played out an entertaining 3-3 draw with Udinese before the international break. However, we are not tempted to put our money on Roberto D’Aversa’s troops this time out as the rock-bottom side want this win more than Sampdoria.

The likes of Izzo, Baselli, and Zaza are all likely to miss the game with injury for the hosts.

Ciro Immobile, who scored his sixth goal of the season, should continue to lead the line for the capital club, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

Udinese, on the other hand, looked sharp in front of goal in a 2-2 draw with Atalanta, and given their attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Adam Masina remains on the sidelines with a knee injury, while fellow defender Leonardo Buta faces race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s showdown.",V
975,Cagliari,Spezia,2020-11-29,N,"Cagliari will be aiming to build on a 3-1 Coppa Italia win over Pisa when they take on Spezia in the opening match of the season. The Sardinians finished the last Serie A season just above the relegation zone, and, no doubt, they are eager to make amends for the unsuccessful campaign. Midfielder Marko Rog is injured for the season opener, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. 

New signing Kevin Strootman will be the man to watch in the home side. Spezia, on the other hand, are eyeing yet another elite division survival. The Black and Whites are tough to beat at home, but they will have a big fish to fry in Monday’s football match. Leo’ Sena is out of contention through injury, while Nzola is a major doubt and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off.",V
739,Napoli,Roma,2020-11-29,V,"There will be fireworks when Napoli and Roma take on each other at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Monday. The Neapolitans suffered a heart-breaking loss to Fiorentina on Matchday 32 to drop to third place in the standings. Luciano Spalletti’s troops are eager to stay in Scudetto race, and they have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Roma. Cameroon international Anguissa is back from suspension, while all Di Lorenzo, Malcuit, Ounas, and Petagna have been struggling with injuries of late. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, came from behind to beat rock-bottom Salernitana at the weekend. Since Jose Mourinho’s troops will go for a win as well, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Lorenzo Pellegrini served his one-game ban against Salernitana, while Leonardo Spinazzola has overcome his long-term injury. ",N

The Rossoneri aim to put icing on the cake on a very successful season, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against the Viola. All Bennacer, Florenzi, and Kjaer continue to miss out through injuries, while talented midfielder Sandro Tonali should keep his place in the starting XI after scoring a late winner in Rome. 

Fiorentina, on the other hand, are eyeing a spot in European competitions. Vincenzo Italiano’s men, though, failed to impress in a 2-1 loss to relegation strugglers Salernitana, which is probably the main reason why we are going to bet on the league leaders. As for the visiting side, both Torreira and Castrovilli remain on the sidelines with injuries. ",V

The Rossoblu aim to put an end to their three-game losing run in the Serie A, and we are positive that they will leave their hearts on the field in Monday’s football match. You should bear in mind that Genoa are after their second win of the season. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, have recorded only one win in the new Serie A campaign as well, meaning that an entertaining encounter is on the cards at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris. Since both teams are likely to go for a win, we believe that punters can find value in betting on both teams to score. Perin is out of contention through suspension for the hosts, while Cassata, Pjaca, Zappacosta, Biraschi, and Criscito are injured.

Il Toro do not seem to be at the top of their game, with the team losing three of their last four league fixtures. Torino failed to spoil Milan’s party at Stadio San Siro at the weekend, and, no doubt, they are low on spirits ahead of the visit of Sampdoria. 

La Samp, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Atalanta. Despite the midweek defeat, Sampdoria have been in a fine form of late, and they are likely to hold Torino to a draw at Stadio Olimpico di Torino. The good news for the visitors is that Bereszynski returns from suspension, but all Augelio, Damsgaard, Verre, and Vieira are out of contention through injuries. ",N

Spezia are eight points clear of the relegation zone, but, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from the Lazio game. Centre-back serves a one-match ban, while the likes of Leo Sena, Reca, Maggiore, and Colley are out of contention with injuries. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from an unlucky defeat to league leaders Milan. The capital club have a chance to climb to the Europa League berth, and they should take advantage of Spezia’s poor form. There are no fresh injury worries in Maurizio Sarri’s team, fit-again defender Luiz Felipe should be recalled to the starting XI. Experienced winger Pedro is pushing for a start as well. ",P

The Nerazzurri kicked off the new Serie A campaign with back-to-back wins over Genoa (4-0) and Verona (1-3), but they dropped two points in a 2-2 draw with Sampdoria at the weekend. 

Since Romelu Lukaku returned to Chelsea in the summer transfer window, fellow attacker Lautaro Martinez will be the man to watch in the home team, while midfielder Sensi should be the only absentee for the hosts. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops did well to beat Verona thanks to Mattias Svanberg’s goal, but given their anything but good away record in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

The Bianconeri are determined to book their place in the Champions League for yet another term, and, no doubt, big-money signing Dusan Vlahovic is capable of helping “The Old Lady” meet the goal. 

Danilo, who scored a late equalizer against the Orobici, misses out through suspension, while both Chiellini and Chiesa remain in the recovery room. Torino, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form, and seeing that they failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Udinese and Venezia, we are tempted to put our money on Juve.

As things stand now, new boss Jose Mourinho is doing a great job with the capital club, who kicked off the new Serie A campaign with back-to-back wins over Fiorentina and Salernitana. The Giallorossi are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, but keep in mind that both Smalling and Spinazzola remain in the recovery room. 

The likes of Pellegrini, Vina, and Mancini are rated doubtful for the game. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, defeated Verona 3-2 in their first away game of the season, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals.

La Samp have been struggling to find their form at the start of the season, with the team still looking for their first triumph of the process. Considering that Marco Giampaolo’s troops failed to impress in a 2-1 loss to Verona, home win should not be considered. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are high on confidence following a 3-2 win over their local rivals Milan. The title holders aim to overtake Atalanta in top position, and we predict that they will take advantage of Sampdoria’s slow start to the season. A man to watch in the away team will be Rafael Leao, who scored a brace in the Derby della Madonnina, while both Alessandro Florenzi and Rade Krunic are out of contention with injuries.",P

Matteo Politano is pushing for a start after finding the net as a substitute in the triumph over Roma. 

Amir Rrahmani, who has been tested positive for coronavirus, is the only absentee in the away team. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, have been struggling in front of goal of late, with the team failing to find the net in the previous three league fixtures. Napoli emerged triumphant in each of their previous four meetings with Crotone, and, taking everything into account, anything but a routine away win should be a major surprise. ",P

Both Frabotta and Hongla should miss out for the hosts, while Croatia international Nikola Kalinic is a major doubt. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Salernitana, and given their poor away record, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Verona. All Godin, Walukiewicz, and Rog are sidelined with injuries for the visiting team, while fit-again forward Leonardo Pavoletti is pushing for a start after scoring as a substitute in the draw with Salernitana.

Benevento made a slow start to the season, but they have been showing signs of improvement of late, with the team beating Fiorentina on the road, while sharing the spoils with Ronaldo-less Juventus. The hosts aim to escape the danger zone, and they are surely capable of matching Parma behind closed doors. 

Schiattarella is banned, while Maggio, Volta, Caldirola, and Iago Falque are all sidelined with injury. The hosts, on the other hand, desperately needed a win at Genoa, and they managed to get one. Parma aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but given Benevento’s current form, we are tempted to put our money on draw.

The Viola experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-0 loss to Torino, but it is well known that they produce much better showings at home than on the travels. Midfielder Sofyan Amrabat is on international duty, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. As always, a man to watch in the home team will be Arsenal target Dusan Vlahovic, who is enjoying a season to remember. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, have been anything but impressive under new boss Andriy Shevchenko, whose feature is in great danger. Given Genoa’s poor away record in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on the Viola this time out.

The Neroverdi failed to find the net in the previous two league fixtures, but bookies still see them as hot favourites to win Friday’s football game. The good news for the hosts is that Defrel should be fit to face Benevento on Matchday 11. 

The visitors, on the other hand, are undefeated in the previous three league fixtures. Following a hard-fought 1-0 win over Fiorentina, Benevento shared the spoils with Juve and Parma in the previous two Serie A games, but they will have a big fish to fry against Sassuolo.

Igor Juric’s men produce much better showings at home than on the travels, and seeing that Andrea Belotti has been raising his form week by week, home win should be considered. 

All Ansaldi, Praet, and Mandragora are rated doubtful for the match, while Rodriguez remains in the recovery room. The Zebrette, on the other hand, failed to win the previous four away games, and they are unlikely to spoil Torino’s party at Stadio Olimpico di Torino.

To make things even worse for the home team, midfielder Jacopo Petriccione is sidelined through suspension. 

Spezia, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Lazio. The visitors are eager to escape the relegation zone, and it seems as if they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. When the two teams met at Stadio Ezio Scida in the Serie B earlier in 2020 Spezia defeated Crotone 2-1, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. ",P

Keep in mind that midfielder Danilo Cataldi is banned for a blasphemous language. 

Verona, on the other hand, continue with their old habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels. Verona often struggle on the road, but the share of spoils is on the cards this time out as Gabriele Cioffi’s troops are undefeated in the previous three meetings with Lazio in the Eternal City.

Austria international Marko Arnautovic, who scored the winner from the penalty spot at the weekend, will be the man to watch in the home team, while all De Silvestri, Michael, and Skov Olsen should miss out with injuries. 

The Romans, as expected, defeated Torino at home thanks to Tammy Abraham’s goal. Jose Mourinho’s troops are eager to stay in the Champions League, and we are positive that they will go for a win in the midweek clash. Since Bologna are a real force to be reckoned with at home, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Even though Zlatan Ibrahimovic is unlikely to recover in time to face Parma, the league leaders are seen as hot favourites to win the match. 

Samu Castillejo, who scored as a substitute in the 2-1 win over Sampdoria, is pushing for a start, as well as talented Norway attacker Hauge. The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, failed to impress in a goalless draw with Benevento, and, no doubt, they face an uphill task in the Stadio San Siro clash.

Caicedo scored a beautiful goal in the 2-1 loss to the Mastini, but he misses the midweek game through suspension. 

Defender Francesco Acerbi picked up a knock in the last league fixture, and he is unlikely to feature against Benevento.

The Bianconeri dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Atalanta, with the Cristiano Ronaldo failing to score the winner from the penalty spot. Juve have been anything but impressive under Antonio Conte in the 2020/21 season, but the game against Parma could be the turning point for CR7 and Co. Arthur and Demiral should be the only absentees in the away team. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are undefeated in the previous four league fixtures. However, home win should not be considered as both Scozzarella and Pezzella suffered injuries in the goalless draw with Cagliari on Wednesday evening.

Defender Wilfried Singo is back from suspension, while all Mandragora, Kone, Verdi, Belotti, and Djidji miss out with injuries.

A man to watch in the home team will be returnee Romelu Lukaku, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend, while Simone Inzaghi should have a full squad to choose from. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, defeated Empoli at home thanks to M’Bala Nzola’s goal in their opener, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in Milano.

Key attacker Umar Sadiq is no longer part of the team, while all Cesar De La Hoz, Alex Centelles, and Inigo Eguaras are out of contention with injuries. 

Osasuna, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-1 win over Rayo Vallecano. Jagoba Arrasate’s men made a fine start to the season, and seeing that the 44-year-old tactician can count on key players for Monday’s showdown, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on the visiting side. Kike Saverio should be the only absentee in the away team. ",V
680,Lazio,Fiorentina,2021-01-06,V,"Lazio and Fiorentina square off against each other at Stadio Olimpico in what is expected to be one of the most exciting games of Wednesday’s program. The Biancocelesti suffered a heavy 4-1 loss to Verona at the weekend, with the team dropping to 8th place in the standings. Maurizio Sarri’s men, though, are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and you should know that they are eyeing their fourth home triumph of the process. Midfielder Mattia Zaccagni should be the only absentee in the home team. 

The Viola, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-0 win over Cagliari. Fiorentina have already recorded three wins on the road this season, and given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered. A man to watch in the away team will be Atletico Madrid target Dusan Vlahovic, who scored a beautiful free-kick goal at the weekend, while both Dragowski and Pulgar remain in the recovery room. ",N

Il Toro aim to build on a 2-1 win over Bologna, but, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from the match as well. In Belotti’ absence, Sarabia should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while all Verdi, Kone, and Djidji are out of contention with injuries. Bremer is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Atalanta. Even though Verona are not regarded as good travelers, we predict that they are going to pick up one point from the match as they are enjoying yet another successful season. All Gunter, Kalinic, Dawidowicz, and Frabotta are injured for the visiting team. ",N

Milan, though, aim to keep on making progress if they are to win their first Scudetto since 2011. Olivier Giroud could replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the starting XI, while Rebic, Messias, Maignan, and Florenzi remain in the recovery room. 

Brahim Diaz has been tested positive for coronavirus. Il Toro, on the other hand, did well to beat Genoa 3-2 in their last league match. Andrea Belotti has lost his place in the starting XI, with Antonio Sanabria continuing to lead the line for the visitors. Anyhow, home win should be considered as Torino are not regarded as good travelers. All Ansaldi, Verdi, Pjaca, and Mandragora miss out with injuries.",V

All Sturaro, Maksimovic, and Vanheusden are sidelined with injuries, while Badelj is a major doubt. 

Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team losing to both Venezia and Sassuolo in the previous two league fixtures. Anyhow, both teams to score betting option should be considered as both sides will be with guards down in Saturday’s clash. Sinisa Mihajlovic has a full squad to choose from for the last game of the season. In the first half of the season the two sides played out a 2-2 draw.",N

Benevento aim to retain their spot in top ten, but they will have to do it without Iago Falque, Viola, Moncini, Caldirola, Letizia, and Volta, who are sidelined with injuries. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to climb to the Champions League berth. Atalanta head into the match following back-to-back wins over Sassuolo (5-1) and Parma (3-0), and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play against Benevento. Even though key midfielder Papu Gomez has been left out of the squad, away win should be considered as Gian Piero Gasperini has a full squad to choose from, except for Mario Pasalic.",P

Udinese are likely to rely on their solid defence in Monday’s clash, but preventing Napoli attackers from scoring is easier said than done. Summer signing Lazar Samardzic is pushing for a start after scoring the winner against Spezia, while both Nestorovski and Udogie remain in the treatment room. 

The Neapolitans came from behind to beat Juventus 2-1 in their last league match, but it has to be noted that the Bianconeri were without several first-team regulars at the weekend. All Demme, Lobotka, and Meret are sidelined with injuries, but Poland international Zielinski returns to the starting XI.

Since the likes of Iacoponi, Gervinho, Grassi, Caviglia, Kucka, Osorio, and Karamoh are all sidelines with injuries, home win should not be considered. The Biancocelesti proved their worth in a 2-1 win over Fiorentina, and seeing that they aim to move a little closer to the Europa League berth, we are tempted to put our money on the capital club, who will be without Correa and Lulic in Sunday’s showdown.",P

Sottil is banned for the hosts, while Dragowski is sidelined through injury. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Sampdoria, and they manage to get one. Cagliari recorded their first win of the season, with the team regaining a much-needed confidence. The Sardinians, though, have been struggling on the travels this season, and they are unlikely to upset Fiorentina at Stadio Artemio Franchi.

Both Abraham and Karsdorp are sidelined through suspension, while Spinazzola, Pellegrini, Villar, and El Shaarawy miss out with injuries. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, are on a three-game winning run in the Italian top flight. Inter faced no difficulties in a 2-0 win over Spezia, with the team remaining in the title race. Simone Inzaghi’s men are likely to adopt yet another attack-minded approach, and given Roma’s attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Juve are eager to regain Scudetto, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Sassuolo. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, will be without Filip Djuricic in the new Serie A campaign as the Serbia forward joined Sampdoria on a free transfer. Summer signing Agustin Alvarez is likely to make his Sassuolo debut against Juventus, but that is unlikely to help the visitors grab something from the match as Massimiliano Allegri’s men are desperate to make a flying start to the season. Keep in mind, though, that all Paul Pogba, Federico Chiesa, Weston McKennie, and Adrien Rabiot miss out with injuries. ",V

The likes of Benassi, Favilli, Miguel Veloso, and Vieira are all out of contention with injuries. 

Crotone, on the other hand, continue to struggle in the Serie A, with the team suffering a 3-1 loss to Dzeko-less Roma in midweek. The rock-bottom side are low on confidence ahead of Sunday’s clash, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Verona’s party at Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi.

All Albin Ekdal, Daniele Verde, Daniel Maldini, and Kelvin Adou should miss out with injuries, whilst Salvador Ferrer faces race against clock to be fit for the match. 

The visiting side, on the other hand, suffered a 2-1 loss to ten-man Milan at the weekend, with the team remaining in the relegation zone. Since Sampdoria have been struggling at the back of late, we do not believe that Spezia will have a better chance than this to return to winning ways in the Italian top flight. To make things even worse for the away team, head coach Marco Giampaolo will watch the game from the stands following his sending off in the last league fixture.",V

The Biancocelesti aim to put an end to their three-game winless run, and they are likely to adopt an attack-minded approach in Sunday’s showdown. Ciro Immobile, who scored a late equalizer from the penalty spot in the midweek draw with Torino, is likely to lead the line for the hosts. 

The Romans, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Udinese on Thursday evening, with the team retaining their spot in top four. The Giallorossi are likely to go for a win in the local derby as well, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

Marko Arnautovic, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line, while defender Adama Soumaoro will have to serve his one-game ban against Verona. 

Anyhow, we predict that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops will find the net in their first home game of the season as Verona experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 5-2 loss to Napoli. The Mastini do not look sharp defensively, but given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Considering that Udinese have been struggling in front of goal of late, we predict that the hosts are going to pick up all three points from Sunday’s showdown.

Both Djidji and Izzo are rated doubtful for the match. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 loss to Inter.

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are running down a blind alley at the moment, with the team losing each of their previous five league fixtures. Since Parma conceded 14 goals in total in the previous five league fixtures, anything but a routine home win would be a big surprise.

To make things even worse for the hosts, key attacker Andrea Belotti is sidelined with injury, as well as fellow striker Simone Verdi. 

Fiorentina, on the other hand, continue to rely on Serbia rising star Dusan Vlahovic, who has been scoring goals for fun in the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign. The Viola aim to keep their Champions League hopes alive, and seeing that Torino are without Andrea Belotti, away win should be considered. Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat is on international duty with Morocco. ",P

The Nerazzurri have been impressive at home ground this season, and, as a result, bookies see them as hot favourites to win Saturday’s football match. D’Ambrosio remains in the recovery room, while Vecino is fit to face Benevento. 

The Gli Stregoni, on the other hand, have been struggling at the back of late, with the team conceding ten goals in total in the previous three league fixtures. Benevento are low on confidence ahead of the trip to Milano, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Inter’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. Sau is banned for the visitors, while Letizia, Volta, and Moncini are all sidelined with injuries. ",V

Sampdoria failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Atalanta, and it is no surprise the bookies see them as underdogs in the clash with Juve. One of the men to watch in the home team will be summer signing Filip Djuricic, who is eager to impress on his debut at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, while there are no fresh injury worries in Marco Giampaolo’s side. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to build on a splendid 3-0 win over Sassuolo, and even though their injury list is pretty full, we are tempted to put our money on the title-chasing side. La Samp defenders should have Serbia attacker Dusan Vlahovic at bay as he scored a brace in the season opener, while all Arthur, Di Maria, Pogba, Chiesa, and Rabiot remain in the recovery room.",P

Summer signing Marko Arnautovic should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while all Schouten, Kingsley, and Bonifazi remain in the recovery room. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are eyeing their fifth consecutive league win. The Stadio San Siro outfit aim to build on a come-from-behind triumph over Verona, but beating Bologna on the road is easier said than done. A close match is on the cards at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara, and we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on draw.

Midfielder Alberto Grassi returns from suspension, while all Goldaniga, Ceppitelli, Nandez, and Strootman are likely to miss the game with injuries. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, did well to beat Atalanta on Matchday 32 to climb to 9th place in the standings. Sassuolo aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

The rock-bottom side are desperate to get back on course, but they will have to do it without injured quartet Cigarini – Riviere – Cuomo – Molina. 

Messias is rated doubtful for the match. Genoa, on the other hand, picked up vital three points from the Cagliari clash, with the team moving away from the relegation zone. Davide Ballardini’s charges are tough to beat at home, but given their anything but brilliant away record, we are tempted to put our money on draw.

Fabian Ruiz has been tested positive for coronavirus, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are eyeing their first league win since November 30, 2020. Parma failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Sampdoria at the weekend, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Napoli’s party at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.

Slovenia international Josip Ilicic is widely expected to return to the starting XI after finding the net in the midweek triumph, whereas all Pessina, Djimsiti, Gosens, Hateboer, Demiral, and Toloi should miss out with injuries. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Fiorentina in their last league match.

Amian is banned for the match, while Leo’ Sena is out of contention through injury. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 3-0 win over Venezia.

You should bear in mind that Jose Mourinho’s troops are eyeing their eighth home win of the process. 

Verona, on the other hand, continue with their habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels, and given their anything but good away record in the 2021/2022 season (3-4-5), we are tempted to put our money on the capital club.

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, did well to crush Bologna 6-1 at the weekend, with the team overtaking their bitter local rivals Milan in top position.

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Cagliari, and they managed to get one, with the team putting an end to their dreadful losing run.

Il Toro made a promising start to the season as well, with the team beating both Monza and Cremonese, while sharing the spoils with Lazio. Ivan Juric has no fresh selection worries, but both Alexey Miranchuk and David Zima remain in the recovery room. In their last encounter in the Italian top flight the two teams played out a thrilling 4-4 draw, and given their fine forms at the start of the season, yet another high-scoring affair is on the horizon.",N

The Rossoblu suffered a heavy 4-0 loss at Inter in their opener, but seeing that they are tough to beat at home, we are tempted to put our money on draw this time out.

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Salernitana and Cremonese. Jose Mourinho has a number of high-profile players to choose from as the club chiefs reinforced the club in the summer transfer window, and given Juve’s attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Considering that all Pelle, Laurini, Nicolussi Caviglia, Hernani, Inglese, Busi, and Valenti are sidelined with injuries, home win should not be considered. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a heavy 3-0 loss to Roma at Stadio Olimpico. Udinese will not have a better chance than this to get back on course, and, taking everything into account, we are tempted to put our money on Rodrigo de Paul and Co.

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-1 win over Udinese. Luciano Spalletti’s troops are only three points behind league leaders Milan, and they will give their best to melt the Rossoneri’s advantage. However, beating Atalanta in Bergamo is easier said than done. A close encounter is on the cards at Gewiss Stadium, and we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on draw.

Edin Dzeko has lost his place in the starting XI, and there is every chance Borja Mayoral will lead the line for the visiting team. 

Zaniolo is out of contention through injury, while Kumbulla and Smalling are rated doubtful for the game. Benevento, on the other hand, have been having their ups and downs in 2021, with the team sitting in the 15th position in the standings.

Rabiot is banned for the hosts, while both Cuadrado and Arthur are out of contention through injuries. Crotone, on the other hand, are fighting hard to survive in the Italian top flight.

A man to watch in the home team will be summer signing Marko Arnautovic, who scored his third goal of the season in a 4-2 loss to Empoli. 

Schouten and Kingsley remain the only absentees in the home team. The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, did well to beat Roma 3-2 in the local derby at the weekend, and given their attacking potential, over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered.

The good news for the hosts is that boss Vincenzo Italiano will have a full squad to choose from against Parma. 

The visitors, on the other hand, have been struggling to find their form in the second half of the season, and, as a result, they sit in the relegation zone ahead of Saturday’s clash. Since Parma are not regarded as good travellers, we are tempted to put our money on Spezia, who totally outplayed title-chasing Milan in their last home game.

Defender De Sciglio, who limped off with injury in the midweek defeat, is likely to drop to the bench, with Alex Sandro stepping up. 

Both Bernardeschi and Kean should miss out as well. The Mastini, on the other hand, came from behind to share the spoils with Udinese in their last league match. Verona have turned their Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi into a real fortress, and given Juve’s poor display in the last league match, home win should be considered.

Portugal forward Beto, who found the net in the triumph over the Biancorossi, will be the man to watch in the home team, while defender Leonardo Buta misses out with injury. 

The Viola, on the other hand, head into the midweek game following back-to-back draws with Empoli and Napoli.

The Orobici, on the other hand, missed out on a spot in European competitions last time out, and, no doubt, they are eager to make amends for the unsuccessful domestic campaign.

You should bear in mind that Napoli are after their fourth consecutive win at home ground. The likes of Manolas, Demme, Lozano, Petagna, Ospina, and Hysaj are all likely to miss the game with injuries. 

The Yellow-Reds, on the other hand, have drawn each of the previous three league fixtures. Benevento, though, were more than fortunate not to suffer a loss to Roma in their last league game, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on Genaro Gattuso’s charges.

Aforementioned attacker Lautaro Martinez is banned for the season opener, while both Alexis Sanchez and Roberto Gagliardini remain in the recovery room. 

Christian Eriksen is still recovering from a heart-attack.

Since Roma head into the match following the Conference League encounter with Leicester City, tired legs could prove to be a big problem for the visiting side.

Samu Castillejo, Franck Kessie, and Alessio Romagnoli have left the club in the summer, but new signings Divock Origi and Charles De Ketelaere should help the title-holders improve their game. 

There are no injury worries in the home team ahead of the season opener.

Fiorentina are not regarded as good travellers, and seeing that they experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-3 draw with Parma, home win should be considered. Igor, Kokorin, and Casatrovilli are sidelined with injuries. ",V

Gianluca Scamacca is pushing for a start after scoring a brace in the last league fixture, while all Filippo Romagna, Filip Djuricic, Matheus Henrique, and Francesco Magnanelli continue to miss out with injuries. Midfielder Hamed Junior Traore is on international duty. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a shocking 2-1 loss to Salernitana, but given their poor away record in the Serie A, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Sassuolo. Hongla represents Cameroon at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, while all Ragusa, Bessa, Cancellieri, Coppola, Cetin, Montipo, and Magnani have been tested positive for coronavirus. ",V

Genoa suffered an embarrassing 6-0 loss to Fiorentina on Monday evening, with the team remaining in the relegation zone ahead of the visit of Udinese. New boss Abdoulay Konko is under big pressure, and, no doubt, his men are going to leave their hearts on the field in Saturday’s clash. 

Mexico defender Johan Vasquez is back from suspension, while all Kallon, Hernani, and Criscito are out of contention with injuries. The Zebrette, on the other hand, faced a tough fixture list at the start of year, with the team losing to both Atalanta and Juventus. Udinese, though, should take advantage of Genoa’s shaky defence.

Sinisa Mihajlovic should have a full squad to choose from for Sunday’s clash. 

La Samp, on the other hand, suffered an embarrassing 3-0 defeat to Monza in front of home fans, and as a result, Marco Giampaolo is no longer in charge of the team. Dejan Stankovic could replace Giampaolo as a new Sampdoria boss, but, taking everything into account, we do not believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors, who are on a four-game losing run in the Serie A. Forward Manuel De Luca remains on the sidelines with a meniscus problem. ",V

Rafael Leao serves a one-game ban, while all Ante Rebic, Divock Origi, Alessandro Florenzi, Rade Krunic, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are likely to miss the game with injuries. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to retain top position, but beating Milan on the road is easier said than done.

The likes of Locatelli, Chiesa, Mckennie, and Kaio Jorge are sidelined with injuries. The Sardinians, on the other hand, are fighting hard to survive in the Italian top flight.

All Valenti, Gagliolo, Iacoponi, Cornelius, Caviglia, Gervinho, and Inglese are sidelined through injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are safe for now, and seeing that the hosts want this win more than the visitors, we predict that Davide Ballardini’s men are going to return home empty-handed. Pellegrini is injured for the visitors, but there are no suspended players in the away team ahead of the trip to Parma. In the first half of the season Parma defeated Genoa 2-1. ",V

Cuadrado is banned for the hosts, while Ramsey, Dybala, Buffon, and Demiral are sidelined with injuries. Alex Sandro is doubtful, whereas Bentacur has been tested positive for coronavirus. The Yellow-Reds, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-1 loss to Fiorentina, and even though Juve head into the match with a severely-weakened squad, home win should be considered.

To make things even worse for the hosts, fellow defender Lucas Martinez Quarta misses the match due to the accumulation of yellow cards.

Alvaro Morata should be recalled to the starting XI after finding the net in the midweek triumph, with Moise Kean likely to drop to the bench. 

Genoa, on the other hand, sit in the relegation zone ahead of the trip to Turin. The Rossoblu failed to impress in a 3-0 loss to Milan, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp this weekend. To make things even worse for the visiting side, their injury list is pretty long, with Sturaro, Maksimovic, Cassata, Caicedo, Criscito, Kallon, Fares, and Destro all missing out.",V

The Nerazzurri are eyeing their fifth consecutive league win, but they can’t afford any complacency in Sunday’s clash. Summer signing Edin Dzeko is not getting any older, and the former Roma attacker is likely to make life difficult the opposition defenders. 

All Darmian, Ranocchia, and Correa are out of contention with injuries for the home team, but Simone Inzaghi can count on key players. The Sardinians, on the other hand, have been struggling on the travels this season, and they are unlikely to spoil Inter’s party in Milano. All Walukiewicz, Rog, and Strootman should miss out with injuries for the visiting team. In their last meeting at “Meazza” Inter defeated Cagliari thanks to Matteo Darmian’s goal. ",V

Fiorentina aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and we are positive they will go for a win in Sunday’s clash. Vincenzo Italiano should have a full squad to choose from. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, were on the verge of beating Juventus in Bergamo, but Danilo eventually scored a late equalizer for “The Old Lady”. Since Atalanta are eager to climb to the Champions League berth, we believe that both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Frabotta is out of contention through injury, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, head into the match with a severely-weakened squad as both Acerbi and Luiz Felipe are banned for the match.

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, aim to move closer to the Europa League berth. Sassuolo, though, should be happy with one point from the game as well, and we are tempted to put our money on draw. Both Bourabia and Defrel are sidelined with injuries, while Ayhan has been tested positive for coronavirus. Berardi and Caputo are rated doubtful for the match, whereas Lukas Haraslin is back from suspension. In the first half of the season Sassuolo defeated Benevento thanks to Domenico Berardi’s goal. ",N

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Milan. Parma aim to take advantage of Cagliari’s poor form, but seeing that all Karamoh, Inglese, Nicolussi Caviglia, Zirkzee, Iacoponi, Cyprien, and Mihaila are sidelined for the visitors, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

Talented defender Pedro Pereira returns from suspension, while midfielder Ahmed Benali is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team losing each of their last three league fixtures. Udinese, though, will not have a better chance than this to get back on course in the Italian top flight, and we predict that they will take advantage of Crotone’s shaky defence.

All Toljan, Djuricic, and Obiang continue to miss out for the hosts, while defender Ferrari is back from suspension. 

The Viola, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Spezia and Atalanta.

All Depaoli, Vieira, and Damsgaard are out of contention with injuries, while Yoshida is a major doubt. You should know that Claudio Ranieri’s troops are eyeing their only second home win of the season. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, showed character in their last league match, with the team beating Empoli thanks to Adrien Tameze’s late goal.

Even though all Ibrahimovic, Florenci, Bennacer, Castillejo, Kjaer, Rebic, and Romagnoli are sidelined with injuries, home win should be considered as Genoa are not regarded as good travellers. 

The Rossoblu have collected only 11 points on the road from possible 48, and given their shaky defence, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise.

All Fares, Buongiorno, Singo, Sanabria, Zaza, and Bremer are out of contention with injuries. 

The Romans, on the other hand, are eager to book their place in the Europa League. Since Roma want this win more than Torino, we predict that Jose Mourinho’s troops are going to pick up all three points from the decider.

The Yellow and Reds experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-2 loss to Udinese, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on Stefano Pioli’s troops.

As for the visiting side, all Cassata, Fares, Rovella, and Caicedo are out of contention with injuries.

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over ten-man Lecce at the weekend, with the team retaining sixth position in the standings. Jose Mourinho’s men aim to climb to the Champions League berth, but seeing that key attacker Paulo Dybala suffered an injury at the weekend, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

Considering that the club chiefs managed to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, away win should be considered. 

Both Arthur and Rabiot are sidelined with injuries, while McKennie, who signed a permanent deal with the club, is out of contention through suspension. The Zebrette, on the other hand, have always been struggling in matches against Juve, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp on Matchday 1.

1085,Benevento,Crotone,2021-05-16,N,"Benevento will be looking to keep their survival hopes alive when they take on Crotone in the Serie A round 37. The Gli Stregoni do not seem to be at the top of their game, but they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. Even though Benevento are on a four-match losing run, home win should definitely be considered as Crotone have nothing to play for. Luca Caldirola is banned for the match, while Marco Sau and Gabriele Moncini are out of contention through injuries. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 5-0 loss to Roma in their last away game, and given the lack of motivation in the away team, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise. Poland defender Arkadiusz Reca remains on the sidelines through injury. ",V
782,Udinese,Sampdoria,2021-05-16,P,"Udinese play host to Sampdoria at their Dacia Arena in what is expected to be an interesting Serie A game. The Zebrette did well to hold Milan to a 1-1 draw at Stadio San Siro, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of Saturday’s clash. Midfielder Ismael Bennacer is back from suspension, while Bram Nutyinck remains on the sidelines with injury. Talented defender Destiny Udogie is pushing for a start after scoring the equalizer against the Rossoneri. 

La Samp, on the other hand, suffered a heavy 4-0 loss to Atalanta in Bergamo on Matchday 27. Marco Giampaolo’s troops are not regarded as good travelers, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. Thorsby is sidelined through suspension, while all Gabbiadini, Askildsen, and Damsgaard are out of contention through injuries. Both Sensi and Quagliarella are rated doubtful for the match. ",V
925,Milan,Cagliari,2021-05-16,N,"Stadio Giuseppe Meazza will host Sunday’s football game between Milan and Cagliari. The Rossoneri are on a quest to regain the Scudetto, but they will have to do it without important midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu, who joined Milan’s bitter local rivals Inter earlier this summer. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out of contention with injury, but influential midfielder Franck Kessie should be fit to face Cagliari. 

In Ibrahimovic’s absence, summer signing Olivier Giroud is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts. The Sardinians, on the other hand, often struggle on the road, and we do not believe that they are capable of grabbing something from the match. Lykogiannis should recover in time to face the Rossoneri, while Rog remains in the recovery room with a knee injury. In their last meeting in Milano the two teams played out a goalless draw, but home win should be considered this time out.",V
1,Fiorentina,Napoli,2021-05-16,P,"Fiorentina play host to Napoli at their Stadio Artemio Franchi on day 3 of the new Serie A campaign. The Viola failed to turn their dominance into victory in a goalless draw with their local rivals Empoli, and it is no wonder they are seen as underdogs in Sunday’s showdown. Despite failing to impress in the Tuscan derby, summer signing Luka Jovic should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while both Gaetano Castrovilli and Igor are out of contention with injuries. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Verona and Monza. The visiting side have been scoring goals for fun at the start of the season, and given Fiorentina’s anything but good display against Empoli, away win should be considered. Midfielder Diego Demme should be the only absentee in the away side. ",P

Both Frabotta and Dawidowicz remain in the recovery room, while a man to watch in the home team will be Antonin Barak, who scored a hat-trick at the weekend. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-0 loss to Napoli. Bologna suffered yet another dip in form, and seeing that Verona have turned their Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi into a real fortress, we predict that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are going to return home empty-handed. Soumaoro is banned for the visitors, while all Dijks, Schouten, and Kingsley are out of contention with injuries. In the first half of the season Bologna defeated Verona 1-0, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge.",V
235,Lazio,Torino,2021-05-18,N,"Buoyed by a thrilling 4-1 win over Genoa, Lazio will look to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they host Torino to their Stadio Olimpico on Saturday. The Biancocelesti quickly bounced back from a heart-breaking loss to Roma, and, no doubt, they are brimming with confidence ahead of the visit of Torino. Ciro Immobile, who scored a hat-trick in Genoa, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, head into the match following a goalless draw with Milan. Ivan Juric’s men are eyeing their third consecutive clean sheet, but preventing Lazio attackers from scoring at Stadio Olimpico is easier said than done. The likes of Fares, Djidji, Mandragora, Sanabria, Praet, and Zaza are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the visiting side.",V

Both Golemic and Magallan are banned for the hosts, while Reca, Di Carmine, Eduardo Henrique, and Cuomo are all out of contention with injuries. 

The Viola, on the other hand, head into the last match of the season with the lack of motivation. Fiorentina have already secured the elite division survival, but given Dusan Vlahovic’s brilliant form, a high-scoring affair is on the cards at Stadio Ezio Scida. Keep in mind that both Dragowski and Pezzella are banned for the match when it comes to away team’s absentees. ",V
76,Cagliari,Genoa,2021-05-22,P,"Sunday’s football game at Sardegna Arena pits together Cagliari and Genoa, the two teams who are eyeing their first wins of the season. The Sardinians kicked off the new Serie A campaign with a 2-2 draw with Spezia, with the team suffering a heavy 4-1 loss at Milan before the international break. Cagliari are eager to give fans some cheer, but this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the home team. 

Both Rog and Cragno are sidelined through injuries for the hosts. The Genoese, on the other hand, are stuck in the relegation zone with the goal difference of 1:6. Considering that the visitors are eager to return to winning ways as well, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Bani remains on the sidelines with a muscle injury, but he should be the only absentee in the visiting side. ",N

La Samp missed out on a place in European competitions, but given their display in a 1-0 win over Udinese, it is more than obvious that they want to finish the season in style. Thorsby is banned for the hosts, while both Ramirez and Adrien Silva are sidelined through injuries. 

The Gli Emiliani, on the other hand, are having a season for forget as they failed to secure the Serie A survival. Given the number of absentees in the away team, we believe that punters can find value in betting on Sampdoria. Kurtic is suspended for the visitors, while all Iacoponi, Man, Caviglia, Pezzella, Osorio, Inglese, Zirkzee, Karamoh, Mihaila, and Cyprien remain in the recovery room. ",V

The Nerazzurri are eyeing their third home win of the process, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Zebrette. Simone Inzaghi should have a full squad to choose from this time out, except for Christian Eriksen, who remains on the sidelines through heart problems. 

Both Edin Dzeko and Arturo Vidal are pushing for a start. Udinese, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Verona. The Zebrette were beaten by Inter in each of the previous three meetings between the two sides in Milano, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, and we are positive that they will find the net in Sunday’s clash. Both Djuricic and Obiang are out of contention for the hosts, but Alessio Dionisi has no fresh injury worries. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-1 win over Sampdoria, but they will have to do it without suspended midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. Anyhow, given Lazio’s attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Ciro Immobile is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. ",N

Ademola Lookman, who scored on his Serie A debut, is widely expected to start against Milan, while all Ederson Jose, Merih Demiral, and Davide Zappacosta are out of contention through injuries. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, started their title defence with a 4-2 in over Udinese, and given their attacking potential, we believe that both teams to score betting option should be considered. Both Sandro Tonalli and Zlatan ibrahimovic are injured for the visiting side. In their last meeting in Bergamo Milan recorded a 3-2 win over Atalanta.",N

Defender Kelvin Amian is back from suspension, but important attacker is banned for the match. Both Sher and Leo’ Sena should miss out with injuries. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, came from two goals behind to share the spoils with Verona in their last league match. Jose Mourinho will watch Sunday’s game from the stands as he was sent off at the weekend, while all El Shaarawy, Ibanez, Shomurodov, Mancini, Spinazzola, Mkhitaryan, and Carles Perez are sidelined with injuries.

Torino will be without injured duo Gojak – Murru in Sunday’s clash, with boss Davide Nicola likely to mix the squad. 

Benevento, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with ten-man Crotone at the weekend, with Simeon Nwankwo’s late goal ruining their survival hopes. Filippo Inzaghi’s troops have little to play for in the last round, and we do not believe that they are going to spoil Il Toro’s party at Stadio Olimpico di Torino. Caprari is a major doubt, while all Sau, Depaoli, Foulon, Ionita, Moncini, and Iago Falque remain in the recovery room. ",V

All Mbaye, Schouten, and Kingsley are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to keep their Champions League hopes alive, but given their poor display in a 1-1 draw with Venezia, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

Considering that the club chiefs did well to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visiting team. 

New goalkeeper Juan Agustin Musso is likely to make his Serie A debut with Atalanta against Torino. All Toloi, De Roon, and Freuler are banned for the match, while Hateboer and Malinovskyi are sidelined with injuries.

42,Sassuolo,Sampdoria,2021-08-29,N,"After beating Verona in the “City of Love” in their opener, Sassuolo will be aiming to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Sampdoria on Matchday 2. The Neroverdi kicked off the new Serie A campaign in style, but they should not stop now. Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, and seeing that all Bourabia, Obiang, and Berardi are eyeing return to the squad, home win should be considered. 

La Samp, on the other hand, are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but they often struggle on the travels. Given Sassuolo’s display in the triumph over Verona, we predict that the visitors are going to return to Genoa empty-handed. In their last meeting at the venue Sassuolo defeated Sampdoria 1-0, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. Midfielder Fabio Depaoli should be fit for Sunday’s showdown.",V

Goalkeeper Juan Musso has joined Duvan Zapata and Berat Djimsiti in the treatment room, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

Fiorentina, on the other hand, proved their worth in a 2-0 home win over Verona, but given their anything but good away record in the 2022/2023 Serie A campaign, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. To make things even worse for the visiting side, important players Castrovilli, Milenkovic, and Amrabat are out of contention through injuries, as well as Dodo and Gollini.",V

Nigeria attacker Victor Osimhen remains on the sidelines through suspension, while both Meret and Demme are sidelined with injuries. 

Important midfielder Zielinski is a major doubt, while Belgium international Mertens has overcome his injury. Juve, on the other hand, failed to impress in an embarassing loss to Empoli before the international break, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. Cristiano Ronaldo returned to Manchester United, while both Arthur and Ramsey are major doubts.

Empoli quickly bounced back from a 3-1 loss to Lazio, with the team shocking Juventus at Allianz Arena thanks to Leonardo Mancuso’s goal. The Gli Azzurri were impressive on the break in the triumph over Juve, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as favourites to win Saturday’s clash. 

Parisi remains on the sidelines with injury, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. The Lagunari, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back defeats to Napoli (0-2) and Udinese (0-3), and they are unlikely to spoil Empoli’s party at Stadio Carlo Castellani.

Fabio Quagliarella, who is not getting any older, is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts, while both Gabbiadini and Torregrossa are out of contention with injuries. 

Bereszynski, on the other hand, will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. Simone Inzaghi’s troops are on a quest to defend their Scudetto. Inter kicked off the new Serie A campaign with back-to-back wins over Genoa (4-0) and Verona (3-1), and given Sampdoria’s difficulties in front of goal, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the away team.

Olivier Giroud has been tested positive for coronavirus, while both Krunic and Kessie are rated doubtful for the game. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, rolled over Spezia 6-1 before the international break to climb to top position in the standings. Considering that both Milan and Lazio will go for a win in Sunday’s Serie A derby, we are tempted to put our money on both teams to score. Full-back Lazzari is sidelined with injury, but he should be the only absentee in the away team. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic could be given a rest after playing three games for the Serbian national team.

Cagliari are eager to give fans some cheer, but this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the home team. 

Both Rog and Cragno are sidelined through injuries for the hosts. The Genoese, on the other hand, are stuck in the relegation zone with the goal difference of 1:6. Considering that the visitors are eager to return to winning ways as well, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.

Igor Juric’s men are desperate to give fans some cheer, and they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. 

Simone Zaza is sidelined with injury, while both Bremer and Belotti are rated doubtful for the game. The newcomers, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level, and given their shaky defence, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Torino.

The Giallorossi are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, but keep in mind that both Smalling and Spinazzola remain in the recovery room. 

The likes of Pellegrini, Vina, and Mancini are rated doubtful for the game. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, defeated Verona 3-2 in their first away game of the season, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals.

Amian is banned for the match, while Leo’ Sena is out of contention through injury. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 3-0 win over Venezia. Udinese are not regarded as good travelers, but given Spezia’s slow start to the season, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Luca Gotti’s charges.

Marko Arnautovic, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line, while defender Adama Soumaoro will have to serve his one-game ban against Verona. 

Anyhow, we predict that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops will find the net in their first home game of the season as Verona experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 5-2 loss to Napoli. The Mastini do not look sharp defensively, but given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Sassuolo are eager to return to winning ways, but they will have to do it without Pedro Obiang, who is out of contention through illness. 

Giacomo Raspadori is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 4-0 win over Salernitana where Antonio Sanabria opened his goal-scoring account. Key attcacker Andrea Belotti is sidelined with injury, as well as Djidji, Izzo, Zaza, and Verdi, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. ",V

Since Romelu Lukaku returned to Chelsea in the summer transfer window, fellow attacker Lautaro Martinez will be the man to watch in the home team, while midfielder Sensi should be the only absentee for the hosts. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops did well to beat Verona thanks to Mattias Svanberg’s goal, but given their anything but good away record in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts.

De Roon misses the match through suspension, while Hateboer and Muriel are both out of contention with injuries. However, away win should be considered as both Ilicic and Malinovskyi return to the starting XI.

Summer signing Mohamed Fares should be handed his full Genoa debut after scoring a brace in the triumph over Cagliari, while both Caicedo and Badelj are sidelined with injuries. 

The Viola, on the other hand, continue to rely on Serbia rising star Dusan Vlahovic, who scored a brace in the triumph over Atalanta, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on both teams to score.

In their last meeting at the venue Sassuolo defeated Salernitana thanks to Domenico Berardi’s goal, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself.

The visitors have been having their ups and downs of late, and seeing that Cagliari want this win more than Torino, home triumph should be considered. Both Rog and Walukiewicz are sidelined with injuries, while Godin is a major doubt.

La Samp, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Lazio. 

Genoa and Sampdoria seem to be evenly matched at the moment, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw.

Fiorentina produce much better showings at home than on the travels, but they will have a mountain to climb in Sunday’s showdown. Luka Jovic is pushing for a start, while Dodo has yet to overcome a calf injury. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, are eyeing their fourth consecutive league win, and given their display in a 4-0 crushing of Spezia, we predict that Giovanni Martusciello’s troops are going to emerge triumphant in the Stadio Artemio Franchi clash as well. With no fresh injury worries to report, Giovanni Martusciello is unlikely to make changes to the team that outplayed the Bianconeri.",P

Midfielder Kristoffer Askildsen is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, played out a 1-1 draw with Torino before the international break. Anyhow, the share of spoils is on the cards in Genoa as Sassuolo and Sampdoria seem to be evenly matched. Rogerio is banned for the visitors, while influential attacking midfielder Djuricic is a major doubt. In the first half of the season the two teams played out a goalless draw.",N

Keep in mind, though, that all Malinovskiy, Muriel, Pasalic, and Koopmeiners have been tested positive for coronavirus. 

Both Josip Ilicic and Duvan Zapata are rated doubtful for the game, while Alexey Miranchuk remains in the recovery room. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina where they failed to convert a penalty.

As always, a man to watch in the home team will be Mussa Barrow as fellow attacker Marko Arnautovic limped off with injury just minutes after scoring the winner against the Viola. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, are eager to record their first win of the process. Empoli’s display in a 2-1 loss to Roma was anything but poor, which is probably the main reason why we predict the visitors are going to hold Bologna to a draw.

There are no injury worries in the home team ahead of the season opener. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, continue to rely on Marko Arnautovic, who has been on Manchester United’s radar of late. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops, though, are not regarded as good travellers, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp in the opening match of the season.

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over ten-man Lecce at the weekend, with the team retaining sixth position in the standings.

The Sardinians, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Sassuolo, and they managed to get one thanks to Alessandro Deiola’s goal. Cagliari, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and given the importance of Sunday’s game for Genoa, we predict that the visiting side will return to Sardinia empty-handed.

Anyhow, the fact that the Neroverdi defeated Atalanta in their last home fixture is surely giving fans a reason for optimism. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 1-1 draw with Bologna, which is probably the main reason why we are going to put our money on draw.

Il Toro made a promising start to the season as well, with the team beating both Monza and Cremonese, while sharing the spoils with Lazio. Ivan Juric has no fresh selection worries, but both Alexey Miranchuk and David Zima remain in the recovery room.

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from an unlucky defeat to league leaders Milan. The capital club have a chance to climb to the Europa League berth, and they should take advantage of Spezia’s poor form.

The visitors, on the other hand, quickly bounced back from the Derby della Madonnina defeat, with the team beating Torino thanks to Marcelo Brozovic’s late goal. Simone Inzaghi’s men proved their worth in the Champions League triumph (2-0) over Plzen as well, but beating the in-form Zebrette on the road is easier said than done.

Amrabat is banned for Monday’s clash, while both Sottil and Castrovilli are out of contention with injuries. Sampdoria, on the other hand, are four points clear of the relegation zone, meaning that they should be happy with one point from the game.

All Fares, Buongiorno, Singo, Sanabria, Zaza, and Bremer are out of contention with injuries. 

The Romans, on the other hand, are eager to book their place in the Europa League. Since Roma want this win more than Torino, we predict that Jose Mourinho’s troops are going to pick up all three points from the decider.

The Azzurri, on the other hand, have nothing to play for in the last round of the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign. Empoli have been struggling at the back of late, and we do not believe that they are capable of upsetting Atalanta at Gewiss Stadium.

Keep in mind that midfielder Danilo Cataldi is banned for a blasphemous language. 

Verona, on the other hand, continue with their old habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels. Verona often struggle on the road, but the share of spoils is on the cards this time out as Gabriele Cioffi’s troops are undefeated in the previous three meetings with Lazio in the Eternal City.

Ederson is banned for the match, while Ranieri misses the decider with injury.

Since Udinese have nothing to play for in Sunday’s clash, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on the home team.

Caretaker boss Alessandro Agostini should have a full squad to choose from for the decider. 

Venezia, on the other hand, have not been competitive at this level, and, as a result, they will compete in the Italian second tier next season. I Lagunari head into Sunday’s clash with the lack of motivation, which is probably the main reason why home win should not be considered.

Samu Castillejo, Franck Kessie, and Alessio Romagnoli have left the club in the summer, but new signings Divock Origi and Charles De Ketelaere should help the title-holders improve their game. 

There are no injury worries in the home team ahead of the season opener.

Gonzalo Escalante is back from suspension, meaning that Massimiliano Alvini will have a full squad to choose from. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to move closer to the playoffs berth. The visitors have been producing fine displays at the start of the season, and they are surely capable of beating the newly-promoted side.

Davide Nicola’s troops defeated Sampdoria in their last meeting in the Italian top flight, which is surely giving fans a reason for optimism ahead of Sunday’s game. 

La Samp, on the other hand, did well to hold Juventus to a goalless draw in their last league match.

Marcelo Brozovic serves a one-game ban, while both Hakan Calhanoglu and Romelu Lukaku miss out with injuries for the home side. 

The capital club, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Atalanta, but seeing that Inter are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we predict that Jose Mourinho’s troops will return to Rome empty-handed.

2004,Spal,Fiorentina,2020-08-02,P,"After rolling over Bologna 4-0 on Matchday 37, Fiorentina will be looking to finish the season in style when they take on Spal at Stadio Paolo Mazza. The Viola are eager to secure a top-ten finish, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the rock-bottom side. Seeing that boss Giuseppe Iachini can count on key players for the last match of the season, away win should be considered. Spal, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-0 loss to Verona. 

Spal head coach Luigi di Biagio has a number of selection worries ahead of the visit of Fiorentina, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the visitors. Luigi di Biagio’s men have not been competitive in the Serie A this term, and it is no wonder they will compete in the Italian second tier next season.",P
