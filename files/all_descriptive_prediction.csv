0,2022-10-21,Juventus,Empoli,"Juventus will be aiming to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win in the Turin derby when they take on Empoli on Matchday 11. The Bianconeri quickly bounced back from a 2-0 loss to Milan, with Dusan Vlahovic scoring the winner against Il Toro, and, no doubt, the Serbia striker will pose a big threat to the opposition back-line. All Angel Di Maria, Mattia De Sciglio, Marley Ake, and Paul Pogba remain in the recovery room, while Friday’s game comes too early for important winger Federico Chiesa, who is back in training. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, aim to build on a win over Monza, but seeing that Juve are eager to rejoin the Scudetto race, home triumph should be considered. As for the away team, all Alberto Grassi, Daniel Akpa, Ardian Ismajli, and Lorenzo Tonelli are out of contention through injuries. ",V
1,2022-10-22,Salernitana,Spezia,"Salernitana and Spezia, the two teams who are almost level on points in the Serie A standings, face each other at Stadio Arechi on day 11 of the new campaign. Salernitana failed to spoil Inter’s party at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, but they are certainly capable of matching Spezia in front of home fans. Experienced midfielder Ivan Radovanovic is back from suspension, while both Giulio Maggiore and Franck Ribery continue to miss out through injuries. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team extending their winless run to three games at the weekend. Anyhow, the share of spoils is on the horizon at Stadio Arechi as the two sides seem to be evenly matched at the moment. Both Simone Bastoni and Arkadiusz Reca are out of contention through injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team. ",N
2,2022-10-22,Milan,Monza,"Milan will be aiming to extend their winning run to four games when they take on Monza in the Serie A round 11. The Rossoneri showed character in a 2-1 win over Verona, with Sandro Tonali sealing the victory ten minutes before the final whistle, and, no doubt, the title holders are high on confidence ahead of Saturday’s game. Keep in mind, though, that Milan’s injury list is pretty long, including the likes of De Ketelaere, Kjaer, Calabria, Maignan, Saelemaekers, Florenzi, and Ibrahimovic. 

The Biancorossi, on the other hand, suffered a 1-0 loss to Empoli at the weekend, and given their anything but good away record (1-1-3), we believe that there is a big value in betting on the home side. Nicolo Rovella is banned for the match, while fellow midfielder Luca Marrone has yet to recover from an ankle problem.",V
3,2022-10-22,Fiorentina,Inter,"Fiorentina and Inter go head to head at Stadio Artemio Franchi in what is expected to be one of the most exciting games of Saturday’s program. The Viola head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Lecce where summer signing Luka Jovic suffered a muscle injury. The Serbia striker misses the Inter game, as well as fellow forward Riccardo Sottil. You should bear in mind that Fiorentina suffered a heavy 4-0 loss to Lazio in their last home game. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Sassuolo and Salernitana. Simone Inzaghi’s troops have been showing signs of improvement of late, and seeing that the hosts will be without Luka Jovic in Saturday’s showdown, away win should be considered. A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Lautaro Martinez, who impressed in a 3-3 draw with Barcelona, while there are no fresh injury worries in the away side.",P
4,2022-10-23,Udinese,Torino,"Following a goalless draw with Lazio, Udinese will be aiming to start a new winning run in the Serie A when they face Torino on Sunday. The Zebrette have been impressive in the first half of the season, and they have yet to suffer a loss in front of home fans. Both Rodrigo Becao and Adam Masina are sidelined with injuries, while fellow defender Leonardo Buta should recover in time to face Il Toro. 

The visitors, on the other hand, are low on spirits following the Turin derby defeat, and given Udinese’s fine record, we do not believe that Ivan Juric’s men are going to grab something from the match. There are no fresh injury worries in the away team, but Ivory Coast defender Wilfried Singo should be recalled to the starting XI. In their last meeting in Udine the Zebrette defeated Il Toro 2-0, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself.",V
5,2022-10-23,Bologna,Lecce,"After failing to spoil Napoli’s party at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Bologna will look to give fans some cheer when they face Lecce on Matchday 11. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men are eager to put an end to their four-match winless run, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against the Giallorossi. However, home win should not be considered as key attacker Marko Arnautovic has yet to recover from a back injury. 

Lecce, on the other hand, head into Sunday’s clash following a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina. The newcomers aim to escape the danger zone as well, and given Arnautovic’s injury, we predict that the visiting side will pick up one point from the match. Defender Antonino Gallo misses out through suspension, but there are no fresh injury worries in the away team ahead of the trip to Emilia-Romagna.",N
6,2022-10-23,Atalanta,Lazio,"Atalanta and Lazio square off against each other at Gewiss Stadium in a highly-anticipated Serie A game. The Orobici aim to overtake Napoli in top position, and we are positive that they will adopt an attack-minded approach in Sunday’s showdown. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be pacey forward Ademola Lookman, who managed to find the net in each of the last three league matches, while all Davide Zappacosta, Rafael Toloi, Juan Musso, and Duvan Zapata remain on the sidelines with injuries. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, have been in a fine form of late as well, with the team winning four of their last five league fixtures, and given their attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Key attacker Ciro Immobile suffered an injury in a goalless draw with Udinese, with Pedro likely to step up. ",N
7,2022-10-23,Roma,Napoli,"All eyes will be on Stadio Olimpico when Roma and Napoli go head to head in the Serie A derby on Matchday 11. The Giallorossi are eyeing their fourth consecutive league win, but beating the high-flying Neapolitans is easier said than done. There are no fresh injury worries in Jose Mourinho’s team, but all Paulo Dybala, Zeki Celik, Georginio Wijnaldum, and Ebrima Darboe remain in the treatment room. 

The visitors, on the other hand, are eyeing their first Scudetto since 1990, and their displays in the first half of the season are surely giving fans a reason for optimism. The league leaders are on a six-game winning run in the Italian top flight, but seeing that Roma are tough to beat at home, we are tempted to put our money on draw. Fit-again Nigeria striker Victor Osimhen is pushing for a start after scoring as a substitute in a 3-2 win over Bologna, while defender Amir Rrahmani has yet to overcome a groin problem.",N
8,2022-10-24,Cremonese,Sampdoria,"There will be fireworks when Cremonese and Sampdoria square off against each other in the relegation six-pointer. Cremonese are eyeing their first win of the season, and we are positive that they will leave their hearts on the field. Both Jack Hendry and Vlad Chiriches remain on the sidelines with injuries, while fellow defender Luka Lochoshvili should recover in time to face La Samp. 

Dejan Stankovic’s troops are eyeing their first triumph of the season as well, but given their poor away record (0-1-3), we believe that there is a big value in betting on the home team. Both Jeison Murillo and Manuel De Luca have been struggling with injuries, and the duo is unlikely to feature in Monday’s showdown. You should bear in mind that the two clubs meet for the first time in the Italian top flight since January 1996 when Sampdoria defeated Cremonese 2-0 in Genoa. ",V
9,2022-10-24,Sassuolo,Hellas Verona,"Monday’s football game between Sassuolo and Verona will bring down the curtain on day 11 of the new Serie A campaign. The Neroverdi aim to make amends for back-to-back losses to Inter and Atalanta, and they are surely capable of matching the Mastini on home soil. Fit-again forward Domenico Berardi is widely expected to return to the starting XI, while both Gregoire Defrel and Mert Muldur continue to miss out with injuries. 

Verona, on the other hand, are on a five-game losing run in the Italian top flight, meaning that Sassuolo will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. Both Kevin Lasagna and Diego Coppola are sidelined with injuries for the visiting side, while defender Federico Ceccherini is back from suspension. In their last encounter in the Serie A Verona outplayed Sassuolo 4-2, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge.",V
