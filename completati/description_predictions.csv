0,2021-08-21,Hellas Verona,Sassuolo,P,"Verona and Sassuolo take on each other in a highly-anticipated Serie A game at Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi on Saturday evening. The Mastini have established themselves as a top-table side in the Italian top flight, but the game against Sassuolo will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. The club chiefs did well to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, but keep in mind that both Lasagna and Faraoni are likely to miss the season opener. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, were producing fine displays in pre-season, with the team beating both Parma and Vicenza, while sharing the spoils with Lazio. Considering that Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Centre-back Marlon is no longer part of the team, while Kyriakopoulos is banned for the match. Obiang is yet another absentee in the away team."
1,2021-08-21,Inter,Genoa,V,"Inter begin their title defence with a match against Genoa at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The club chiefs failed to keep hold of key attacker Romelu Lukaku in the summer transfer window, but, as things stand now, fellow striker Lautaro Martinez is likely to stay at the club. Summer signings Denzel Dumfries, Hakan Calhanoglu, and Edin Dzeko are all pushing for a start. Aforementioned attacker Lautaro Martinez is banned for the season opener, while both Alexis Sanchez and Roberto Gagliardini remain in the recovery room. 

Christian Eriksen is still recovering from a heart-attack. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, kicked off their Coppa Italia campaign with a 3-2 win over Perugia, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the reigning champions. Both Bani and Benhrami are out of contention through suspensions, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered."
2,2021-08-21,Torino,Atalanta,P,"Atalanta will look to make a flying start to the season when they take on Torino at Stadio Olimpico di Torino. The Orobici suffered a 3-1 loss to Juventus in their last warm-up game, but the bookies still see them as hot favourites to win Saturday’s clash. Considering that the club chiefs did well to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visiting team. 

New goalkeeper Juan Agustin Musso is likely to make his Serie A debut with Atalanta against Torino. All Toloi, De Roon, and Freuler are banned for the match, while Hateboer and Malinovskyi are sidelined with injuries. Il Toro, on the other hand, failed to impress in their Coppa Italia opener against Cremonese as they defeated the Serie B side on penalties. Both Ansaldi and Belotti are rated doubtful for the Atalanta game, and, taking everything into account, home win should not be considered."
3,2021-08-21,Empoli,Lazio,P,"Newcomers Empoli will be aiming to kick off the new Serie A campaign in style when they host Lazio to their Stadio Carlo Castellani on Saturday evening. The Azzurri have big ambitions for the 2021/22 season, but they will have a big fish to fry in the opener. Leonardo Mancuso, who scored 20 goals in the Serie B last term, will be the man to watch in the home team. New boss Aurelio Andreazzoli should have a full squad to choose from against Lazio. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, are eyeing a top-four finish in the new Serie A campaign. The capital club were producing fine displays in pre-season, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as favourites to win Saturday’s clash. Since new head coach Maurizio Sarri can count on key players for the opening match of the season, away win should be considered. "
4,2021-08-22,Udinese,Juventus,N,"After failing to impress in the 2020/21 Serie A campaign, Juventus will be looking to make a flying start to the new domestic campaign when they take on Udinese at Dacia Arena. Massimiliano Alegri replaced Andrea Pirlo as Juve boss, and, no doubt, the fans have faith in the new head coach. Considering that the club chiefs managed to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window, away win should be considered. 

Both Arthur and Rabiot are sidelined with injuries, while McKennie, who signed a permanent deal with the club, is out of contention through suspension. The Zebrette, on the other hand, have always been struggling in matches against Juve, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp on Matchday 1. Udinese star player Rodrigo De Paul joined Atletico Madrid earlier this summer, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. "
5,2021-08-22,Napoli,Venezia,V,"Napoli and Venezia go head to head in a David-vs-Goliath clash at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. The Neapolitans are determined to regain the Serie A trophy, and, no doubt, they will give 100% to kick off the new season in style. Lorenzo Insigne, who impressed at the EURO 2020 finals, will be the man to watch in the home team, while all Ghoulam, Demme, Lozano, and Mertens are out of contention with injuries. 

Centre-back Manolas, on the other hand, will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. The newcomers, on the other hand, secured promotion to the Serie A thanks to a win over Cittadella in the playoffs final double-header. The Lagunari are tough to beat at home, but they are unlikely to spoil Napoli’s party at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona as fans return to the stands. All Vacca, Mazzocchi, Modolo, and Aramu are banned for the visitors, while Lezzerini is sidelined through injury."
6,2021-08-22,Bologna,Salernitana,V,"Bologna play host to Salernitana at their Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in the opening match of the season. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops were having their ups and downs in pre-season, but they failed to impress in their Coppa Italia opener against Ternana (4-5). The Rossoblu are desperate to get back on course, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at the newcomers. 

Dijks is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. Summer signing Marko Arnautovic will be the man to watch in the home team. Salernitana, on the other hand, did well to beat Reggina in their Italian Cup opener, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in Sunday’s football match. Since Bologna have turned their Stadio Renato Dall’Ara into a real fortress, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. Di Tacchio is banned for the match, while Veseli is out of contention through injury."
7,2021-08-22,Roma,Fiorentina,V,"Roma will look to make a flying start to the new Serie A campaign when they take on Fiorentina at their Stadio Olimpico on Sunday evening. The Giallorossi did well to crush Raja Casablanca 5-0 in their last warm-up game, and they are likely to adopt yet another attacking style of play. This game comes too early for big-money signing Tammy Abraham, but fellow new recruit Eldor Shomurodov should lead the line for the hosts. 

Edin Dzeko is no longer part of the team, while Spinazzola remains in the recovery room after suffering an injury at the EURO 2020 finals. The Viola, on the other hand, should be without key attacker Dusan Vlahovic in Sunday’s clash as the Serbian rising star is on the verge of leaving the club. Since Fiorentina are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Jose Mourinho’s troops. Nordin Amrabat is injured for the visiting team."
8,2021-08-23,Sampdoria,Milan,P,"All eyes will be on Stadio Luigi Ferraris when Sampdoria and Milan square off against each other in the Serie A opener. La Samp were impressive in pre-season, and, to make things even better for the fans, they outplayed Alessandria (3-2) in the opening match of their Coppa Italia campaign. Considering that Sampdoria look sharp in front of goal at the moment, we predict that they are going to find the net in Monday’s clash. 

New boss Roberto D’Aversa should have a full squad to choose from for the Serie A opener. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, will be without injured duo Kessie-Ibrahimovic in the Stadio Luigi Ferraris showdown. Olivier Giroud, though, is likely to make his Serie A debut against Sampdoria, and, taking everything into account, both teams to score betting option should be considered."
9,2021-08-23,Cagliari,Spezia,N,"Cagliari will be aiming to build on a 3-1 Coppa Italia win over Pisa when they take on Spezia in the opening match of the season. The Sardinians finished the last Serie A season just above the relegation zone, and, no doubt, they are eager to make amends for the unsuccessful campaign. Midfielder Marko Rog is injured for the season opener, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. 

New signing Kevin Strootman will be the man to watch in the home side. Spezia, on the other hand, are eyeing yet another elite division survival. The Black and Whites are tough to beat at home, but they will have a big fish to fry in Monday’s football match. Leo’ Sena is out of contention through injury, while Nzola is a major doubt and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off."
10,2021-08-27,Hellas Verona,Inter,P,"Buoyed by a thrilling 4-0 win over Genoa, Inter will be aiming to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Verona at Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi on Friday evening. Romelu Lukaku kicked off the new Serie A campaign with a 4-0 win over Genoa, with summer signing Edin Dzeko opening his goal-scoring account. Fellow new recruit Hakan Calhanoglu impressed in the season opener as well, and he is likely to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. 

The good news for the vising team is that important attacker Lautaro Martinez returns from suspension. The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Sassuolo, but seeing that they experienced all sorts of problems at the back in their opener, we are tempted to put our money on Simone Inzaghi’s troops. Experienced midfielder Miguel Veloso is banned for the hosts."
11,2021-08-27,Udinese,Venezia,V,"After holding star-studded Juventus to a 2-2 draw, Udinese will be looking to return to record their first win of the season when they take on Venezia at their Dacia Arena. The Zebrette showed character in their opener, with the team coming from two goals behind to share the spoils with Juve, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as favourites to win Friday’s game. Rodrigo de Paul joined Atletico Madrid earlier this summer, and, in his absence, a man to watch in the home team will be Argentina international Roberto Pereyra. 

Gerard Deulofeu is pushing for a start, while Ilija Nestorovski remains in the recovery room. The newcomers, on the other hand, failed to make life difficult for ten-man Napoli (0-2) in their opener. Since Venezia are not regarded as good travelers, home win should be considered. Crnigoj and Busio are both likely to miss the game with injuries."
12,2021-08-28,Juventus,Empoli,P,"Juventus and Empoli go head to head at Allianz Stadium in a David-vs-Goliath clash on Matchday 2. Juve dropped a two-goal advantage in a 2-2 draw with Udinese, but they are widely expected to beat the newcomers in front of home fans. Cristiano Ronaldo, who had a goal disallowed for offside in the dying minutes of the season opener, returns to the starting XI, while USA international Weston McKennie returns from suspension. 

Adrien Rabiot is sidelined with a muscle injury. Empoli, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 defeat to Lazio, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp on day 2 of the new Serie A campaign. Keep in mind, though, that Aurelio Andreazzoli should have a full squad to choose from for the Allianz Stadium clash. "
13,2021-08-28,Lazio,Spezia,V,"After recording a come-from-behind win at Empoli, Lazio will be aiming to record their first home win of the season when they take on Spezia on Saturday evening. The Biancocelesti proved their worth in the season opener, and, as a result, the bookies see them as favourites to beat the Bianconeri. A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who impressed in the triumph over Empoli, while both Danilo Cataldi and Bobby Adekanye remain in the recovery room. 

Spezia, on the other hand, are not regarded as good travelers, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the capital club. In their last meeting in the “Eternal City” Lazio defeated Spezia 2-1, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. There should be no absentees in the away team. "
14,2021-08-28,Atalanta,Bologna,N,"Atalanta will be aiming to build on a 2-1 win over Torino when they take on Bologna at Gewiss Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The Orobici want to continue where they left last season, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Rossoblu. Both Freuler and Toloi return from suspensions, while Zapata and Hateboer remain on the sidelines with injuries. Marten De Roon is banned for the match. 

Bologna, on the other hand, came from behind to beat newcomers Salernitana 3-2 at home ground, with summer signing Marko Arnautovic opening his goal-scoring account. The Rossoblu, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Atalanta’s party in Bergamo. Soriano is suspended for the match, while both Dijks and Santander are likely to miss the game with injuries. "
15,2021-08-28,Fiorentina,Torino,V,"Fiorentina will be aiming to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Roma when they face Torino at their Stadio Artemio Franchi on Matchday 2. The Viola will be without suspended goalkeeper Bartlomiej Dragowski in Saturday’s clash, while Sofyan Amrabat remains in the recovery room. Atletico Madrid target Dusan Vlahovic is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts. Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-1 loss to Atalanta. 

Andrea Belotti, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend, is widely expected to return to the starting XI, but seeing that Torino are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on Fiorentina. Simone Zaza remains in the recovery room, while Cristian Ansaldi is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. "
16,2021-08-29,Sassuolo,Sampdoria,N,"After beating Verona in the “City of Love” in their opener, Sassuolo will be aiming to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Sampdoria on Matchday 2. The Neroverdi kicked off the new Serie A campaign in style, but they should not stop now. Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, and seeing that all Bourabia, Obiang, and Berardi are eyeing return to the squad, home win should be considered. 

La Samp, on the other hand, are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but they often struggle on the travels. Given Sassuolo’s display in the triumph over Verona, we predict that the visitors are going to return to Genoa empty-handed. In their last meeting at the venue Sassuolo defeated Sampdoria 1-0, and we predict that the history is going to repeat itself. Midfielder Fabio Depaoli should be fit for Sunday’s showdown."
17,2021-08-29,Genoa,Napoli,P,"After surviving Venezia with ten men on the field in their opener (2-0), Napoli will be looking to keep their 100% record intact when they take on Genoa at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Attacker Victor Osimhen is banned for the match following his sending off in the triumph over Venezia, while Piotr Zielinski is out of contention through injury. Since Dries Mertens remains in the recovery room as well, away win should not be considered. 

A man to watch in the away team will be Lorenzo Insigne, who opened his goal-scoring account at the weekend. The Rossoblu suffered a heavy 4-0 loss at Inter in their opener, but seeing that they are tough to beat at home, we are tempted to put our money on draw this time out. The good news for the hosts is that both Mattia Bani and Valon Behrami return to contention after serving their bans in the defeat to Inter."
18,2021-08-29,Milan,Cagliari,V,"Stadio Giuseppe Meazza will host Sunday’s football game between Milan and Cagliari. The Rossoneri are on a quest to regain the Scudetto, but they will have to do it without important midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu, who joined Milan’s bitter local rivals Inter earlier this summer. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out of contention with injury, but influential midfielder Franck Kessie should be fit to face Cagliari. 

In Ibrahimovic’s absence, summer signing Olivier Giroud is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts. The Sardinians, on the other hand, often struggle on the road, and we do not believe that they are capable of grabbing something from the match. Lykogiannis should recover in time to face the Rossoneri, while Rog remains in the recovery room with a knee injury. In their last meeting in Milano the two teams played out a goalless draw, but home win should be considered this time out."
19,2021-08-29,Salernitana,Roma,P,"Buoyed by a 3-1 win over Fiorentina, Roma will be looking to overtake Inter in top position in the standing when they take on newcomers Salernitana on Sunday. New signing Tammy Abraham proved his worth in the season opener, with the former Chelsea striker providing two assists for his teammates, and, no doubt, the pacey England international will pose a big threat for the opposition defenders. 

Zaniolo is banned for the match, while both Smalling and Spinazzola are likely to miss the game through injuries. Salernitana, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2 loss to Bologna, meaning that a high-scoring affair is on the cards at Stadio Arechi. Norway defender Strandberg misses the game through suspension, while Frederic Veseli has yet to recover from a knee injury. Anyhow, the Romans are closer to picking up all three points from the match than the newcomers."
20,2021-09-11,Atalanta,Fiorentina,P,"Gewiss Stadium in Bergamo will host Saturday’s football game between Atalanta and Fiorentina, the two teams who are almost level on points in the Serie A standings. Atalanta kicked off the new domestic campaign with a 2-1 win over Torino, with the team sharing the spoils with Bologna in their second game of the season. The Orobici aim to return to winning ways, and we are positive that they will adopt an attack-minded approach against Fiorentina. 

Luis Muriel is fully fit as he did not play for Colombia for the September qualifiers, while Slovenia international Josip Ilicic could be given a rest. De Roon is banned for the match, while Hateboer remains in the recovery room. The Viola, on the other hand, quickly bounced back from a 3-1 loss to Roma, with the team beating Torino 2-1 at home before the international break. However, home win should be considered as Fiorentina are not regarded as good travelers. There should be no absentees in the away team. "
21,2021-09-11,Empoli,Venezia,P,"Empoli and Venezia, the two newcomers, take on each other at Stadio Carlo Castellani in what is expected to be an entertaining game. Empoli quickly bounced back from a 3-1 loss to Lazio, with the team shocking Juventus at Allianz Arena thanks to Leonardo Mancuso’s goal. The Gli Azzurri were impressive on the break in the triumph over Juve, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as favourites to win Saturday’s clash. 

Parisi remains on the sidelines with injury, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. The Lagunari, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back defeats to Napoli (0-2) and Udinese (0-3), and they are unlikely to spoil Empoli’s party at Stadio Carlo Castellani. Maenpaa has yet to overcome his injury, but there are no suspended players in the away team. "
22,2021-09-11,Napoli,Juventus,V,"Napoli will be aiming to keep their 100% record in the new Serie A campaign intact when they take on Juventus at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. The Neapolitans experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a friendly against Benevento (1-5), but it has to be noted that Luciano Spalletti rested first-team regulars for the Serie A derby. Nigeria attacker Victor Osimhen remains on the sidelines through suspension, while both Meret and Demme are sidelined with injuries. 

Important midfielder Zielinski is a major doubt, while Belgium international Mertens has overcome his injury. Juve, on the other hand, failed to impress in an embarassing loss to Empoli before the international break, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. Cristiano Ronaldo returned to Manchester United, while both Arthur and Ramsey are major doubts. Bentacur will be assessed ahead of the kick-off, while Colombia international Cuadrado should be given a rest. "
23,2021-09-12,Cagliari,Genoa,P,"Sunday’s football game at Sardegna Arena pits together Cagliari and Genoa, the two teams who are eyeing their first wins of the season. The Sardinians kicked off the new Serie A campaign with a 2-2 draw with Spezia, with the team suffering a heavy 4-1 loss at Milan before the international break. Cagliari are eager to give fans some cheer, but this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the home team. 

Both Rog and Cragno are sidelined through injuries for the hosts. The Genoese, on the other hand, are stuck in the relegation zone with the goal difference of 1:6. Considering that the visitors are eager to return to winning ways as well, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Bani remains on the sidelines with a muscle injury, but he should be the only absentee in the visiting side. "
24,2021-09-12,Spezia,Udinese,P,"Spezia will be aiming to make amends for a heavy 6-1 loss to Lazio when they take on Udinese at Stadio Alberto Picco on Sunday afternoon. Spezia have been anything but impressive at the start of the season, and, no doubt, they would be more than satisfied with the Serie A survival at the end of the process. Amian is banned for the match, while Leo’ Sena is out of contention through injury. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 3-0 win over Venezia. Udinese are not regarded as good travelers, but given Spezia’s slow start to the season, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Luca Gotti’s charges. Both Forestieri and Nestorovski miss the game with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team ahead of Sunday’s clash."
25,2021-09-12,Sampdoria,Inter,N,"Stadio Luigi Ferraris will host Sunday’s Serie A clash between Sampdoria and Inter. La Samp have yet to find the net in the new domestic campaign, and, no doubt, they will fight tooth and nail against the Nerazzurri. Fabio Quagliarella, who is not getting any older, is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts, while both Gabbiadini and Torregrossa are out of contention with injuries. 

Bereszynski, on the other hand, will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. Simone Inzaghi’s troops are on a quest to defend their Scudetto. Inter kicked off the new Serie A campaign with back-to-back wins over Genoa (4-0) and Verona (3-1), and given Sampdoria’s difficulties in front of goal, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the away team. Chile international Alexis Sanchez is rated doubtful for the game, but Simone Inzaghi has no fresh injury concerns. "
26,2021-09-12,Roma,Sassuolo,V,"Roma will look to climb to top position in the standings when they take on Sassuolo at their Stadio Olimpico. As things stand now, new boss Jose Mourinho is doing a great job with the capital club, who kicked off the new Serie A campaign with back-to-back wins over Fiorentina and Salernitana. The Giallorossi are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, but keep in mind that both Smalling and Spinazzola remain in the recovery room. 

The likes of Pellegrini, Vina, and Mancini are rated doubtful for the game. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, defeated Verona 3-2 in their first away game of the season, and, taking everything into account, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Midfielder Pedro Obiang should be the only absentee in the away team, whilst Roma defenders should have Domenico Berardi at bay."
27,2021-09-12,Milan,Lazio,V,"Milan and Lazio go head to head at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in what is expected to be one of the most exciting games of Sunday’s program. The Rossoneri aim to build on back-to-back wins over Sampdoria and Cagliari, and the good news for the hosts is that key attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic returns to the starting XI. Olivier Giroud has been tested positive for coronavirus, while both Krunic and Kessie are rated doubtful for the game. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, rolled over Spezia 6-1 before the international break to climb to top position in the standings. Considering that both Milan and Lazio will go for a win in Sunday’s Serie A derby, we are tempted to put our money on both teams to score. Full-back Lazzari is sidelined with injury, but he should be the only absentee in the away team. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic could be given a rest after playing three games for the Serbian national team. "
28,2021-09-12,Torino,Salernitana,V,"Torino failed to impress in the 2020/2021 Serie A campaign, with the team finishing the process in 17th position in the standings, just above the relegation zone. Il Toro continue to struggle in the new domestic campaign as well, with the team losing to both Atalanta and Fiorentina. Igor Juric’s men are desperate to give fans some cheer, and they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. 

Simone Zaza is sidelined with injury, while both Bremer and Belotti are rated doubtful for the game. The newcomers, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level, and given their shaky defence, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Torino. Both Djuric and Veseli are out of contention through injuries, but there are no suspended players in the visiting team."
29,2021-09-13,Bologna,Hellas Verona,V,"Bologna and Verona take on each other at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in the last game of the Serie A day 3. The Rossoblu did well to beat Salernitana 3-2 in their opener, with the team holding Atalanta to a goalless draw in Bergamo before the international break. Summer signing Marko Arnautovic has already started paying off, meaning that the opposition defenders should have the controversial Austria attacker at bay. Vignato is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back defeats to Sassuolo (2-3) and Inter (1-3), and seeing that Bologna have turned their Stadio Renato Dall’Ara into a real fortress, we predict that the visitors will return home empty-handed. There should be no absentees in the away team in Monday’s showdown as Miguel Veloso returns from suspension."
30,2021-09-17,Sassuolo,Torino,P,"Sassuolo and Torino go head to head at Mapei Stadium – Citta del Tricolore in what is expected to be an entertaining Serie A game. The start of the season has been a mixed bag for the Neroverdi, who defeated Verona (3-2), shared the spoils with Sampdoria (0-0), while losing to Roma at the weekend. Sassuolo are eager to return to winning ways, but they will have to do it without Pedro Obiang, who is out of contention through illness. 

Giacomo Raspadori is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 4-0 win over Salernitana where Antonio Sanabria opened his goal-scoring account. Key attcacker Andrea Belotti is sidelined with injury, as well as Djidji, Izzo, Zaza, and Verdi, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. "
31,2021-09-18,Inter,Bologna,V,"Stadio Giuseppe Meazza will host Saturday’s football game between Inter and Bologna, the two teams who sit in top six ahead of Matchday 4. The Nerazzurri kicked off the new Serie A campaign with back-to-back wins over Genoa (4-0) and Verona (1-3), but they dropped two points in a 2-2 draw with Sampdoria at the weekend. 

Since Romelu Lukaku returned to Chelsea in the summer transfer window, fellow attacker Lautaro Martinez will be the man to watch in the home team, while midfielder Sensi should be the only absentee for the hosts. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops did well to beat Verona thanks to Mattias Svanberg’s goal, but given their anything but good away record in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. Both Schouten and Kingley are out of contention with injuries for the visiting team. "
32,2021-09-18,Genoa,Fiorentina,P,"Stadio Luigi Ferraris will host Saturday’s football game between Genoa and Fiorentina, who defeated Cagliari (3-2) and Atalanta (2-1) respectively on Matchday 3. The Rossoblu regained a much-needed confidence at the weekend, but they will have a big fish to fry against Fiorentina. Summer signing Mohamed Fares should be handed his full Genoa debut after scoring a brace in the triumph over Cagliari, while both Caicedo and Badelj are sidelined with injuries. 

The Viola, on the other hand, continue to rely on Serbia rising star Dusan Vlahovic, who scored a brace in the triumph over Atalanta, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on both teams to score. Defender Lorenzo Venuti misses the match through injury, but the 26-year-old should be the only absentee in the away team. "
33,2021-09-18,Salernitana,Atalanta,P,"Atalanta will look to make amends for a 2-1 loss to Fiorentina when they take on Salernitana on day 4 of the new Serie A campaign. The Orobici have yet to find their best form, but they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. De Roon misses the match through suspension, while Hateboer and Muriel are both out of contention with injuries. However, away win should be considered as both Ilicic and Malinovskyi return to the starting XI. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level. Salernitana have been struggling at the back in the new Serie A campaign, and given Atalanta’s attacking potential, anything but a routine away win would be a major surprise. All Aya, Ruggeri, Veseli, Capezzi, and Jaroszynski are out of contention through injuries for the home team."
34,2021-09-19,Lazio,Cagliari,N,"Lazio play host to Cagliari at their Stadio Olimpico on day 4 of the new Serie A campaign. The Biancocelesti aim to bounce back from a 2-0 loss to Milan, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Sardinians. Head coach Maurizio Sarri will watch the game from the stands as he was sent off in the Stadio San Siro showdown, but the good news for the hosts is that the experienced tactician has a full squad to choose from. 

As always, Cagliari defenders should have Ciro Immobile at bay. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2 loss to Genoa, and seeing that all Godin, Ceter, Rog, and Strootman are sidelined with injuries, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the capital club. Lazio are eyeing their seventh consecutive win over Cagliari in the Serie A."
35,2021-09-19,Empoli,Sampdoria,P,"Stadio Carlo Castellani will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Empoli and Sampdoria, the two teams who sit in the bottom half of the table. Following a historical 1-0 win at Juventus, Empoli suffered a shocking 2-1 loss to fellow newcomers Venezia at the weekend to drop to 12th place in the standings. The Gli Azzurri aim to return to winning ways as soon as possible, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against Sampdoria. 

Defender Riccardo Fiamozzi should be the only absentee in the home team. La Samp, on the other hand, are eyeing their first win of the process. Since both sides are likely to go for a victory in Sunday’s clash, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Gabbiadini remains on the sidelines through injury, while Ekdal is a major doubt and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off."
36,2021-09-19,Hellas Verona,Roma,V,"All eyes will be on Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi when Verona and Roma go head to head in the Serie A round 4. The Mastini made a slow start to the season, with the team losing each of their first three league games, and, no doubt, they are low on confidence following Monday’s defeat at Bologna. All Casale, Miguel Veloso, and Tameze are sidelined with injuries, while Ruegg and Frabotta are rated doubtful for the match. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, aim to keep their 100% record under Jose Mourinho intact. Given Verona’s poor form at the start of the season, we believe that away win should be considered. Wing-bank Spinazzola remains the only absentee in the away side, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on Jose Mourinho’s charges. In their last meeting in the Italian top flight Roma defeated Verona 3-1."
37,2021-09-19,Venezia,Spezia,P,"Buoyed by a 2-1 win over fellow newcomers Empoli, Venezia will be looking to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they take on Spezia on Matchday 4. I Lagunari’s main goal is to secure the Serie A survival, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to turn the dream into reality. All Aramu, Fiordilino, Peretz, and Lezzerini are likely to miss the game with injuries, while David Okereke is pushing for a start after finding the net in the triumph over Empoli. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back defeats to Lazio (1-6) and Udinese (0-1), and seeing that Venezia regained a much-needed confidence at the weekend, home win should be considered. Amian returns from suspension, but both Erlic and Neo’ Sena are out of contention through injuries, speaking of the visiting team. The two teams have never met before in the Serie A."
38,2021-09-19,Juventus,Milan,N,"There will be fireworks when Juventus and Milan face each other in the Serie A derby at Allianz Stadium. Juve continue life without Cristiano Ronaldo, who was sorely missed in the first three games of the season. With only one point in their pocket from possible nine, Massimiliano Allegri’s men sit in the danger zone, but the game against their old rivals could be the turning point for the hosts. Since all Alex Sandro, Bentacur, Cuadrado, Danilo, and Dybala all return from international duties, home win should be considered this time out. 

All Arthur, Chiesa, and Kaio Jorge are sidelined with injuries, while Bernardeschi is a major doubt. The Rossoneri aim to keep their 100% record in the new Serie A campaign intact, but beating Juve at Allianz Stadium is easier said than done. Juventus want this win more than Milan, and that is the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the Bianconeri. Both Bakayoko and Krunic are injured for the visiting team."
39,2021-09-20,Udinese,Napoli,P,"Udinese and Napoli go head to head at Dacia Arena in the closing match of the Serie A round 4. The Zebrette aim to build on back-to-back wins over Venezia (3-0) and Spezia (1-0), with the team eyeing their third consecutive clean sheet of the process. Udinese are likely to rely on their solid defence in Monday’s clash, but preventing Napoli attackers from scoring is easier said than done. Summer signing Lazar Samardzic is pushing for a start after scoring the winner against Spezia, while both Nestorovski and Udogie remain in the treatment room. 

The Neapolitans came from behind to beat Juventus 2-1 in their last league match, but it has to be noted that the Bianconeri were without several first-team regulars at the weekend. All Demme, Lobotka, and Meret are sidelined with injuries, but Poland international Zielinski returns to the starting XI. Since Dries Mertens is fit for the match as well, away win should be considered. Important winger Lorenzo Insigne is rated doubtful for the game."
40,2021-09-21,Fiorentina,Inter,P,"Stadio Artemio Franchi will host Tuesday’s Serie A game between Fiorentina and Inter. The Viola aim to extend their winning run to four games, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play. Despite failing to find the net in a 2-1 win at Genoa, Atletico Madrid target Dusan Vlahovic should continue to lead the line for the hosts. Gaetano Castrovilli has joined Lorenzo Venuti and Michele Cerofolini in the recovery room, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, did well to crush Bologna 6-1 at the weekend, with the team overtaking their bitter local rivals Milan in top position. The title holders aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and given their attacking potential, over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered. Both Stefano Sensi and Gabriel Brazao miss out with injuries for the visitors."
41,2021-09-21,Bologna,Genoa,N,"Bologna and Genoa take on each other at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in an all-Rossoblu clash. Bologna aim to bounce back from a heavy loss (1-6) to Inter, with the team eyeing their third win of the season. Summer signing Marko Arnautovic is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts, while both Jerdy Schouten and K. Dogo Michael remain in the recovery room. Genoa, on the other hand, suffered their third defeat of the process at the weekend, with the team losing to Fiorentina in front of home fans. 

Vincenzo Italiano’s troops aim to get back on course as soon as possible, but seeing that Bologna are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we are tempted to put our money on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops. You should bear in mind, though, that Bologna failed to beat Genoa in the previous six meetings between the two teams in the Serie A."
42,2021-09-21,Atalanta,Sassuolo,V,"Atalanta and Sassuolo take on each other in a highly-anticipated Serie A game at Gewiss Stadium in Bergamo. The Orobici failed to impress in their last league match, but thanks to Duvan Zapata’s goal they eventually defeated newcomers Salernitana on the road. The triumph surely gave Atalanta footballers a confidence boost, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at the Neroverdi. Josip Ilicic is widely expected to return to the starting XI, while both Luis Muriel and Hans Hateboer are out of contention with injuries. 

Sassuolo, on the other hand, head into the match following back-to-back defeats to Roma and Torino. Considering that Atalanta aim to regain their spot in top four, we predict that the visitors will return home empty-handed. Pedro Mba Obiang is out of contention with heart problems, while Filippo Romagna misses out through knee injury. "

I Granata do not seem to be competitive at this level, with the team losing each of their four league fixtures, but their display in the defeat to Atalanta was anything but poor. Defender Mattero Ruggeri remains on the sidelines with injury, while all Aya, Capezzi, and Veseli are rated doubtful for the midweek clash. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to build on a come-from-behind win over Roma. Verona did well to record their first win of the season, but seeing that they are not regarded as good travelers, the share of spoils is on the cards at Stadio Arechi. All Frabotta, Ruegg, Sutalo, and Veloso are out of contention through injuries. You should know that under 2.5 goals have been netted in five of the previous six meetings between the two clubs. "
44,2021-09-22,Cagliari,Empoli,P,"Wednesday’s football game at Sardegna Arena pits together Cagliari and Empoli, the two teams who sit in the danger zone ahead of Matchday 5. The Sardinians are desperate to record their first win of the season, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Empoli. Cagliari showed signs of improvement in a 2-2 draw with Lazio, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. 

Defender Gabriele Zappa is banned for the midweek clash, while all Ceter Valencia, Godin, Ladinetti, Rog, and Strootman are out of contention with injuries. The Gli Azzurri, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 3-0 loss to Sampdoria, and, taking everything into account, they are unlikely to spoil Cagliari’s party at Sardegna Arena.

The Rossoneri came from behind to share the spoils with Juventus at the weekend, with Ante Rebic scoring a late equalizer. Milan aim to stay in the title race, but keep in mind that important defender Simon Kjaer has joined Davide Calabria, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Rade Krunic, and Tiemoue Bakayoko in the recovery room. 

Venezia, on the other hand, suffered a heart-breaking 2-1 loss to Spezia at the weekend, and given their shaky defence, we believe that Milan will return to winning ways on Matchday 5. In Ibrahimovic’s absence, Rafael Leao is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts. All Lezzerini, Fiordilino, and Ala-Myllymaki are injured for the visiting team. In their last meeting in the Serie A, back in 2002, Milan defeated Venezia 4-1."
46,2021-09-22,Spezia,Juventus,P,"After sharing the spoils with Milan in the Serie A derby, Juventus will be aiming to return to winning ways when they take on Spezia at Stadio Alberto Pico. Massimiliano Alegri’s troops have yet to find their best form in the new Serie A campaign, but the midweek clash could be the turning point for Federico Chiesa and Co. Talented attacker Moise Kean could sneak into the starting XI, while all Arthur, Kaio Jorge, and Nicolussi Caviglia are sidelined with injuries. 

Spezia, on the other hand, climbed to 13th position in the standings thanks to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Venezia. Thiago Motta’s troops aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but seeing that the visitors want this win more than the hosts, we predict that Juve will pick up all three points from the match. Croatia defender Martin Erlic, who limped off with injury at the weekend, is unlikely to feature against Juventus."

Il Toro aim to build on back-to-back wins over Salernitana and Sassuolo, and they are surely capable of matching the Biancocelesti, who struggle at the back. Even though key attacker Andrea Belotti remains on the sidelines with injury, we predict that the in-form hosts are going to grab something from the match. 

In Belotti’s absence, Sanabria will continue to lead the line for Torino. The capital club, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 2-2 draw with Cagliari. Since Maurizio Sarri’s troops are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on Il Toro this time out. Attacker Bobby Adekanye should be the only absentee in the away team, while Danilo Cataldi is pushing for a start after scoring the equalizer at the weekend."

Sampdoria aim to build on a 3-0 win over Empoli, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in the midweek clash. Veteran Fabio Quagliarella should be rested against Napoli, while fellow attacker Francesco Caputo should keep his place up front after scoring a brace in the triumph over Empoli. 

Manolo Gabbiadini should be the only absentee in the home team. The Neapolitans, on the other hand, made a promising start to the season, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on both teams to score. All Demme, Lobotka, and Meret are likely to miss the game with injuries for the visiting team, while Sampdoria defenders should have Lorenzo Insigne at bay."

Henrikh Mkhitaryan is widely expected to return to the starting XI. The Zebrette, on the other hand, suffered four defeats in the previous five meetings with Roma in the Serie A.

Genoa aim to return to winning ways, but the game against Verona will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, head into the match following a 2-2 draw with Salernitana. Since Verona are determined to return to winning ways as well, we are tempted to put our money on both teams to score.

The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-1 win over Sassuolo. Atalanta have been showing signs of improvement of late, but seeing that they have yet to find their best form in the new Serie A campaign, we are tempted to put our money on Simone Inzaghi’s troops.

Theo Hernandez is pushing for a start after finding the net in the midweek triumph. 

The hosts, on the other hand, suffered a 3-2 loss to Juventus on Wednesday evening despite taking the lead after 49 minutes.

70,2021-10-16,Spezia,Salernitana,V,"After suffering a heavy 4-0 loss to Verona before the international break, Spezia will be looking to return to winning ways when they take on Salernitana in the Serie A round 8. The Bianconeri are eyeing their second win of the season, and they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. Bastoni is banned for the hosts, while all Bourabia, Colley, Sala, Leo’Sena, and Agudelo are out of contention through injuries. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Genoa, and they managed to get one. Salernitana regained a much-needed confidence before the international break, but given their poor away record in the Italian top flight, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on Spezia. The visitors will be without Ruggeri, Ribery, Coulibaly, Bogdan, and Capezzi in Saturday’s game."
71,2021-10-16,Lazio,Inter,V,"Lazio will be aiming to make amends for a 3-0 loss to Bologna when they take on Inter at Stadio Olimpico on Saturday evening. The Biancocelesti have been having their ups and downs of late, but they need to start winning on a regular basis if they are to represent Italy in European competitions next season. Since important defender Francesco Acerbi misses the match through suspension, home win should not be considered. 

Ciro Immobile is a major doubt, and the capital club’s key player will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, came from behind to beat Sassuolo 2-1 in their last league match. Even though top scorer Romelu Lukaku left the club in the summer, the reigning champions have been producing fine displays under new boss Simone Inzaghi, and they are likely to spoil Lazio’s party in the “Eternal City”. Both Arturo Vidal and Lautaro Martinez are likely to miss the game due to the international duties. "
72,2021-10-16,Milan,Hellas Verona,V,"After defeating Atalanta 3-2 before the international break, Milan will be aiming to regain top position in the standings when they take on Verona at their Stadio San Siro on Saturday evening. The Rossoneri made a promising start to the season, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to win their first Scudetto since 2011. Florenzi is sidelined with injury, but Ibrahimovic could recover in time to face the Mastini. 

Both Maldini and Calabria are rated doubtful for the game. Verona, on the other hand, did well to crush Spezia 4-0 in their last league match. Considering that Verona have been scoring goals for fun of late, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. In their last meeting at Stadio San Siro the two teams played out a 2-2 draw. Both Ruegg and Frabotta miss out with injuries, while Faraoni and Ilic are major doubts."
73,2021-10-17,Napoli,Torino,V,"High-flying Torino will look to keep their 100% record in the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign intact when they host Torino to their Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Matchday 8. The Neapolitans made a flying start to the season, and, no doubt, they are brimming with confidence ahead of Sunday’s clash. Hirving Lozano should be rested after representing Mexico in the World Cup qualifiers on Thursday, while all Ounas, Malcuit, and Lobotka are sidelined with injuries. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, aim to recover from the Turin derby defeat, but given Napoli’s current form, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise. All Pjaca, Praet, and Verdi are out of contention with injuries, while Pobega is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. In their last meeting in the Serie A Napoli defeated Torino 2-0."
74,2021-10-17,Juventus,Roma,V,"All eyes will be on Allianz Stadium when Juventus and Roma take on each other in the Serie A derby on Sunday evening. The Bianconeri made a slow start to the season, but they are on a three-game winning run ahead of the visit of Roma. Paulo Dybala, who returned to training, could play some part in Sunday’s clash, while all Aaron Ramsey, Alvaro Morata, and Adrien Rabiot are sidelined with injuries. 

Juan Cuadrado is unlikely to feature against Roma as he was on international duty with Colombia. The Giallorossi, on the other hand, aim to build on a routine 2-0 win over Empoli. The capital club, though, produce much better showings at home than on the travels, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on Massimiliano Allegri’s troops. Both Smalling and Spinazzola miss out with injuries for the away side."
75,2021-10-17,Genoa,Sassuolo,N,"Genoa and Sassuolo square off against each other at Stadio Luigi Ferraris in what is expected to be a very exciting Serie A game. The Rossoblu aim to put an end to their four-match winless run, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Neroverdi. All Maksimovic, Cassata, Sturaro, Buksa, Biraschi, and Vanheusden are out of contention with injuries, while Destro and Criscito will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

Despite producing a fine display against Inter, the Neroverdi were eventually beaten by the Nerazzurri before the international break. Since Sassuolo are eager to return to winning ways, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Midfielder Obiang remains on the sidelines through illness, but he should be the only absentee in the away side. You should bear in mind that 11 goals in total have been netted in the previous three meetings between the two sides."
76,2021-10-17,Empoli,Atalanta,P,"Sunday’s football game at StadioCarlo Castellani pits together Empoli and Atalanta, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign. Empoli’s main goal is to secure the survival, while Atalanta are once again eyeing a place in the Champions League. The newcomers failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Roma before the international break, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as underdogs in Sunday’s clash. 

Fiamozzi is out of contention with injury, while both Pinamonti and Ricci are rated doubtful for the game. The Orobici, on the other hand, are eager to make amends for a 3-2 loss to Milan, and they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. Duvan Zapata is unlikely to feature against Empoli after representing Colombia in the World Cup qualifiers, but his compatriot Luis Muriel should start. All Hateboer, Pessina, Djimsiti, and Gosens miss out with injuries. "
77,2021-10-17,Cagliari,Sampdoria,V,"Cagliari will look to record their first win of the season when they take on Sampdoria at Sardegna Arena on day 8 of the new Serie A campaign. The Rossoblu aim to put an end to their seven-game winless run, and we are positive that they will leave their hearts on the field. Keep in mind, though, that all Rog, Ceppitelli, Ceter, and Walukiewicz are sidelined with injuries for the home team. 

La Samp, on the other hand, played out an entertaining 3-3 draw with Udinese before the international break. However, we are not tempted to put our money on Roberto D’Aversa’s troops this time out as the rock-bottom side want this win more than Sampdoria. Both Vieira and Verre are injured, but there are no suspended players in the away team ahead of the trip to Sardinia. "
78,2021-10-17,Udinese,Bologna,N,"Udinese and Bologna take on each other at Dacia Arena in what is expected to be one of the most exciting games of Sunday’s program. The Zebrette played out a thrilling 3-3 draw with Sampdoria before the international break, with the team extending their winless run to four games. Udinese aim to give fans something to cheer about, but this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, aim to build on a 3-0 win over Lazio, but given their anything but good away record in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on draw. Both Nesterovski and Perez are injured for the hosts, while Pussetto is a major doubt. As for the visitors, Jerdy Schouten should be the only absentee as Nigeria international Kingsley Michael has overcome his long-term injury."
79,2021-10-18,Venezia,Fiorentina,V,"Venezia play host to Fiorentina at their Stadio Pierluigi Penzo in the Serie A round 8. The newcomers aim to escape the danger zone, while the Viola are eager to retain their spot in top five. Venezia head into Monday’s clash following back-to-back draws with Torino and Cagliari, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry against Viola. Fiorentina continue to rely on Atletico Madrid target Dusan Vlahovic, who scored the winner for Serbia in the World Cup qualifier against Luxembourg. 

The Viola are more of a team than I Lagunari, and we predict that the visitors are going to prove their worth on the field. Goalkeeper Luca Lezzerini should be the only absentee in the home team, while all Milenkovic, Castrovilli, and Saponara are rated doubtful for the visitors. Fiorentina goalkeeper Dragowski is out of contention through injury."
80,2021-10-22,Sampdoria,Spezia,V,"Sampdoria will look to bounce back from a 3-1 loss to Cagliari when they face Spezia on Matchday 9. La Samp have been playing some high-scoring games of late, with over 2.5 goals being netted in each of their last six league fixtures. Head coach Roberto D’Aversa will watch the game from the stands as he was sent off at the weekend. As for Sampdoria players, Thorsby is banned, while both Vieira and Damsgaard are sidelined with injuries. 

Spezia, on the other hand, aim to build on a 2-1 win over Salernitana, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play.

Il Toro aim to bounce back from an expected 1-0 loss to Napoli, with the team eyeing their third win of the season. All Mandragora, Verdi, and Pjaca remain in the recovery room, while fit-again attacker Belotti should be recalled to the starting XI. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, aim to escape the relegation zone. 

Genoa head into the match following a 2-2 draw with Sassuolo, and they are eager to put an end to their five-game winless run in the Italian top flight. Genoa, though, are not regarded as good travelers, which is the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. It has to be noted that all Maksimovic, Vanheusden, Hernani, and Cassata are out of contention through injuries for the visiting team. "
82,2021-10-23,Salernitana,Empoli,P,"After suffering a 2-1 loss at Spezia, Salernitana will look to get back on course in the Serie A when they take on Empoli at their Stadio Arechi. I Granata are stuck at the bottom of the table, and, no doubt, they are likely to fight tooth and nail against the Gli Azzurri. All Coulibaly, Ruggeri, Bogdan, and Capezzi are out of contention through injuries, while Bonazzoli is a major doubt. 

The visitors, on the other hand, head into the match following back-to-back defeats to Roma and Atalanta. Empoli aim to regain their spot in top ten, but beating Salernitana on the road is easier said than done. A close match is on the horizon at Stadio Arechi, and we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. Both Fiamozzi and Romagnoli are out of contention through injuries for the visiting team."
83,2021-10-23,Sassuolo,Venezia,V,"After sharing the spoils with Genoa in their last league match, Sassuolo will look to return to winning ways when they take on Venezia on Matchday 9. The two teams are level on points in the Serie A standings, but given the number of high-profile footballers in the home team, the Neroverdi are seen as favourites to win Saturday’s match. Both Ayhan and Obiang are sidelined with injuries, while Traore and Boga are major doubts. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, did well to shock Fiorentina on Monday evening, with the team escaping the relegation zone. Venezia, though, are not considered good travelers, and they are unlikely to spoil Sassuolo’s party at Mapei Stadium – Citta del Tricolore. Both Fiordilino and Lezzerini are out of contention through injuries, while Johnsen is rated doubtful for the game. Anyhow, home win should be considered."
84,2021-10-23,Bologna,Milan,P,"All eyes will be on Stadio Renato Dall’Ara when Bologna and Milan go head to head in the Serie A round 9. The Rossoblu head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Udinese, and, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from Saturday’s clash as well. Summer signing Marko Arnautovic should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while all Schouten, Kingsley, and Bonifazi remain in the recovery room. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are eyeing their fifth consecutive league win.

Verona are eager to get back on course as soon as possible, but, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from Sunday’s clash as well. 

Frabotta is out of contention through injury, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, head into the match with a severely-weakened squad as both Acerbi and Luiz Felipe are banned for the match. Since Lazio are not regarded as good travelers, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. As always, Ciro Immobile will lead the line for the visitors."

The Nerazzurri suffered a 3-1 loss to Lazio at the weekend, but it has to be noted that Lautaro Martinez missed the game due to international commitments. The Argentina international returns to the starting XI, and he is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line. Inter boss Simone Inzaghi should have a full squad to choose from. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to extend their winning run to five games. Juve have been in a fine form of late, but seeing that Inter are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we are tempted to put our money on draw.

As for the visitors, Udinese failed to win the previous five league fixtures.

Bani is a major doubt, while all Fares, Cassata, Maksimovic, Hernani, and Vanheusden are out of contention with injuries. You should know that Genoa are after their first home win of the process. 

Venezia, on the other hand, suffered a heart-breaking 2-1 loss to Salernitana, with the team remaining in the danger zone. Since Genoa will not have a better chance than this to get back on course, we are tempted to put our money on the home side. All Johnsen, Lezzerini, Vacca, and Fiordilino should miss out with injuries for the visiting team, while Ampadu is banned."
105,2021-10-31,Salernitana,Napoli,P,"Sunday’s football game at Stadio Arechi pits together Salernitana and Napoli, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2021/2022 Serie A season. Salernitana’s main goal is to secure the elite division survival, and, no doubt, a win over Venezia gave fans a reason for optimism. All Bogdan, Capezzi, Coulibaly, and Ruggeri should miss out with injuries. The Neapolitans, on the other hand, are eager to retain top position in the standings. 

Napoli have been impressive in the Italian top flight ever since Luciano Spalletti took over the reins, and given Salernitana’s shaky defence, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the title-chasing visitors. Both Malcuit and Ounas are out of contention with injuries, while Manolas should be fit for the match. In their last meeting in a competitive game Napoli outplayed Salernitana 3-0, which is yet another reason why away win should be considered."
106,2021-10-31,Inter,Udinese,V,"After recording a routine 2-0 win over Empoli, Inter will be aiming to melt Milan’s advantage in the Serie A table when they host Udinese to their Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The Nerazzurri are eyeing their third home win of the process, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Zebrette. Simone Inzaghi should have a full squad to choose from this time out, except for Christian Eriksen, who remains on the sidelines through heart problems. 

Both Edin Dzeko and Arturo Vidal are pushing for a start. Udinese, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Verona. The Zebrette were beaten by Inter in each of the previous three meetings between the two sides in Milano, which is yet another reason why we are tempted to put our money on the hosts. Gerard Deulofeu should be the only absentee in the away team. "
107,2021-10-31,Roma,Milan,P,"There will be fireworks when Roma and Milan square off against each other at Stadio Olimpico in the Serie A derby. The Romans aim to build on a 2-1 win over Cagliari, where they came from behind to pick up all three points. Jose Mourinho’s men aim to melt Milan’s advantage in the Serie A standings to six points, but this game will be anything but a walk in the park for the Giallorossi. Both Smalling and Spinazzola are out of contention with injuries for the capital club. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, did well to beat Torino 1-0 thanks to Olivier Giroud’s goal, with the team retaining top position in the standings. Milan, though, will have a much bigger fish to fry in Sunday’s derby. A close encounter is on the cards in the “Eternal City”, and we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. Ante Rebic is a major doubt, while Florenzi remains in the recovery room."
108,2021-10-31,Sassuolo,Empoli,P,"Buoyed by a 2-1 win over Juventus, Sassuolo will be aiming to move closer to the Conference League berth when they take on Empoli at their Mapei Stadium – Citta del Tricolore. The Neroverdi have been in a fine form of late, and it is no wonder the odds for home win keep on dropping. Both Djuricic and Boga are likely to miss the game with injuries. The Azzurri, on the other hand, failed to upset title-holders Inter in their last league match. 

The newcomers have been struggling at the back of late, and they are unlikely to grab something from the Mapei Stadium – Citta del Tricolore clash. Ricci is banned for the visitors, while all Fiamozzi, Romagnoli, and Di Francesco are out of contention through injuries. In their last meeting at the venue Sassuolo defeated Empoli 3-1, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered."
109,2021-11-01,Bologna,Cagliari,V,"Bologna and Cagliari go head to head at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in what is expected to be an interesting Serie A game. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men have been having their ups and downs in the first half of the season, and, as a result, they sit in 10th position in the standings. Bologna aim to move closer to the Europa League berth, and they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. Key attacker Marko Arnautovic is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, are stuck at the bottom of the table. Cagliari failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Fiorentina (0-3) and Roma (1-2), and seeing that Bologna are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the visitors are likely to return to Sardinia empty-handed. All Rog, Strootman, Dalbert, Godin, Ceter, Nandez, and Caceres have been struggling with injuries of late for the visiting side."
110,2021-11-05,Empoli,Genoa,N,"Empoli will be looking to build on a 2-1 win over Sassuolo when they host Genoa to their Stadio Carlo Castellani on Matchday 12. The Gli Azzurri have been having their ups and downs of late, but the win at Sassuolo surely gave them a confidence boost. Midfielder Petar Stojanovic serves a one-game ban, while Furlan is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the match. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, have been anything but impressive in the 2021/2022 Serie A season. Genoa have recorded only one win in the Italian top flight this term, and given Empoli’s display in the triumph over Sassuolo, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. All Destro, Maksimovic, Hernani, Bani, Vanheusden, Fares, and Cassata are out of contention with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team."
111,2021-11-06,Cagliari,Atalanta,P,"Sardegna Arena will host Saturday’s football game between Cagliari and Atalanta, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign. Cagliari’s main goal is to avoid relegation, while Atalanta are eyeing yet another participation in the Champions League. The Sardinians are on a three-game losing run in the Italian top flight, and given their shaky defence, home win should be considered. 

Caceres is sidelined through suspension, while all Ceter, Rog, Dalbert, and Walukiewicz are likely to miss the game with injuries. Keita is a major doubt. The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to regain their spot in top four, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play. Since Atalanta have been impressive on the road this season, we predict that Josip Ilicic and Co. are going to pick up all three points from the match. All Djimsiti, Gosens, Hateboer, Toloi, and Pessina remain in the recovery room. "
112,2021-11-06,Juventus,Fiorentina,V,"All eyes will be on Allianz Stadium when Juventus and Fiorentina face each other in the Serie A round 12. The Bianconeri do not seem to be at the top of their game, with the team losing to both Sassuolo and Verona in the previous two league fixtures, but Max Allegri’s troops should not be written off just yet. All Kean, De Sciglio, and Ramsey are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

USA international McKennie is pushing for a start as he found the net in the defeat to the Mastini. The Viola, on the other hand, continue to rely on Serbia rising star Dusan Vlahovic, who scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 win over Spezia. Fiorentina, though, have been anything but impressive on the road of late, which is the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on draw. Both Pulgar and Dragowski are out of contention with injuries, while Gonzalez has been tested positive for coronavirus."
113,2021-11-06,Spezia,Torino,V,"After suffering a heavy 3-0 loss to Fiorentina at the weekend, Spezia will look to escape the relegation zone when they take on Torino on Matchday 12. The Bianconeri experienced all sorts of problems at the back in their last league match, and it is no wonder the odds for away win have been dropping. All Bourabia, Hristov, Leo’Sena, Sher, Agudelo, and Nguiamba remain in the recovery room, while Reca is a major doubt. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, continue with their habit of producing fine displays at home, while struggling on the travels. Torino rolled over Sampdoria 3-0 in front of home fans at the weekend, but given their three-game winless run in the Italian top flight, we believe that there is a big value in betting on draw. Pobega is banned for the match, whereas all Pjaca, Brekalo, Ansaldi, and Mandragora miss out with injuries."
114,2021-11-07,Udinese,Sassuolo,V,"Sunday’s football match at Dacia Arena pits together Udinese and Sassuolo, the two mid-table sides. The Zebrette failed to win the previous eight league fixtures, and, no doubt, they are determined to put an end to the negative trend. Argentina forward Ignacio Pussetto remains in the recovery room, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. Fit-again winger Gerard Deulofeu is pushing for a start. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a shocking 2-1 loss to Empoli. Since Sassuolo are likely to stick to their attacking style of play, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Lopez is out of contention through suspension, while both Djuricic and Ayhan remain on the sidelines with injuries. In their last meeting in Udine the Zebrette defeated the Neroverdi 2-0."
115,2021-11-07,Milan,Inter,N,"The ground at Stadio San Siro (Giuseppe Meazza) will shake when Milan and Inter take on each other in Derby della Madonnina on Matchday 12. The Rossoneri have been impressive in the first half of the season, with the team recording ten wins and one draw in the process. Milan aim to build on a 2-1 win over Roma, and they are surely capable of matching their bitter local rivals. Zlatan Ibrahimovic should keep his place up front after scoring the opener in the Stadio Olimpico clash, while Theo Hernandez will have to serve his one-game ban. 

All Rebic, Messias, Florenzi, Maignan, and Plizzari remain in the treatment room. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, recorded a hard-fought 2-0 win over Udinese at the weekend. Inter aim to stay in the Scudetto race, and seeing that they will go for a win in the local derby, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Simone Inzaghi should have a full squad to choose from for the Derby della Madonnina."

La Samp aim to escape the danger zone, and they are surely capable of matching the Rossoblu in front of home fans. Adrien Silva is sidelined through suspension, while all Verre, Vieira, and Damsgaard miss out with injuries. 

Bologna did well to beat Cagliari 2-0 on home soil at the weekend, but given their poor away record in the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on Sampdoria. Sinisa Mihajlovic can’t count on the likes of Bonifazi, Schouten, Kingsley, and Viola for Sunday’s clash, but there are no suspended players in the away team ahead of the trip to Genoa."
117,2021-11-07,Venezia,Roma,V,"Roma will look to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Milan when they take on Venezia at Stadio Pierluigi Penzo on Sunday.

Both Smalling and Spinazzola are out of contention with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team. Former Chelsea attacker Abraham is widely expected to lead the line for the Giallorossi. 

Venezia, on the other hand, failed to win the previous three league fixtures. I Lagunari are eager to escape the danger zone, but given their anything but good form, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Jose Mourinho’s troops. It has to be noted that all Vacca, Lezzerini, Fiordilino, and Johnsen miss out with injuries for the hosts."

Lazio are eyeing a place in European competitions, while Salernitana’s main goal is to secure the top flight survival. Ciro Immobile, who found the net in a 2-2 draw with Atalanta, will be the man to watch in the home team, while Lucas Leiva is pushing for a start. 

Midfielder Mattia Zaccagni should be the only absentee in the home team. The newcomers, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Napoli. I Granata should find it hard to secure the Serie A survival, and given Lazio’s fine home record, we predict that the visitors will return to Salerno empty-handed.

Important defender Koulibaly remains on the sidelines through suspension, while both Ounas and Malcuit are sidelined with injuries. 

Manolas and Osimhen are facing race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s clash. The Mastini did well to beat fallen giants Juventus 2-1 at the weekend, with the team extending their winning run at home to four games. Verona, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and that is the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the league leaders. Serbia midfielder Ivan Ilic should be the only absentee in the away side."

The Viola are eyeing their third consecutive win at home, but they will have to do it without key centre-back Nikola Milenkovic. To make things even worse for the hosts, fellow defender Lucas Martinez Quarta misses the match due to the accumulation of yellow cards. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, are eager to overtake Napoli in top position in the standings. Milan are enjoying a very successful season, and given Fiorentina’s difficulties at the back, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on the visiting side. All Plizzari, Calabria, Castillejo, and Maignan are injured for the visitors, while both Ballo-Toure and Romagnoli are major doubts."

Montenegro international Adam Marusic has been tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over ten-man Fiorentina. Max Allegri’s troops aim to revived their Scudetto hopes, and seeing that they will go for a win in Saturday’s clash as well, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 2-0 loss to Juventus, and given their poor away record in the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the league leaders. Key attacker Ciro Immobile is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off, while Montenegro international Adam Marusic remains in the recovery room."

The Giallorossi quickly bounced back from a shocking 3-2 loss to Venezia, but they need to keep on making progress if they are to represent Italy in the Champions League next season. Ghana rising star Felix Afena-Gyan is pushing for a start after the 18-year-old scored a brace in the last league match. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, produce much better showings at home than on the travels, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on Jose Mourinho’s troops. Veretout is banned for the hosts, while both Cristante and Villar have been tested positive for coronavirus. As for the visiting team, all Ansaldi, Rodriguez, Mandragora, and Verdi are out of contention with injuries."

The Orobici have been in a fine form in November, and it is no wonder the bookies see them as hot favourites to win the midweek clash. Duvan Zapata, who scored the winner at the weekend, should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while defender Matteo Lovato misses out through injury. Slovenia international Josip Ilicic is pushing for a start. 

The newcomers, on the other hand, failed to upset title holders Inter (0-2) in their last league match. Venezia obviously struggle in matches against top-table sides, and they are unlikely to spoil Atalanta’s party in Bergamo. All Ebuehi, Fiordilino, and Maenpaa should miss out with injuries for the visiting team. In their last meeting in a competitive match, back in 2004, Venezia defeated Atalanta 1-0, meaning that the Orobici are hungry for revenge."

The Viola aim to bounce back from a heart-breaking loss to their local rivals Empoli, and they are surely capable of matching La Samp in front of home fans. Serbia rising start Dusan Vlahovic, who scored his 11th goal of the season in the Tuscan derby, will be the man to keep an eye on in the home team, whilst all Benassi, Dragowski, Nastasic, and Pulgar should miss out with injuries. 

Roberto D’Aversa’s troops, on the other hand, came from behind to beat Verona 3-1 in their last league match. The bad news for the visitors, though, is that defender Alex Ferrari limped off with injury at the weekend. Since Sampdoria are not regarded as good travelers, we are tempted to put our money on Dusan Vlahovic and Co. this time out. "

Both Frabotta and Hongla should miss out for the hosts, while Croatia international Nikola Kalinic is a major doubt. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Salernitana, and given their poor away record, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Verona. All Godin, Walukiewicz, and Rog are sidelined with injuries for the visiting team, while fit-again forward Leonardo Pavoletti is pushing for a start after scoring as a substitute in the draw with Salernitana.

Salernitana’s main goal is to secure the elite division survival, while Juve are eyeing a place in the Champions League. I Granata did well to hold Cagliari to a 1-1 draw at the weekend, but it is well known that the newcomers struggle in matches against top-table sides. 

All Coulibaly, Ribery, Kastanos, Russo, Schiavone, and Strandberg have been struggling with injuries of late. Max Allegri’s troops, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a heart-breaking loss to Atalanta. Juve have been underperforming in the new Serie A campaign, but this game could be the turning point for the “Old Lady”.

Both Djuricic and Boga are sidelined with injuries, while Obiang continues to miss out through illness. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, rolled over Lazio 4-0 at the weekend, with the team retaining top position in the standings. Given Napoli’s attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Keep in mind, though, that key attacker Osimhen is injured for the visitors, as well as Ounas and Anguissa. Both Ounas and Politano have been tested positive for coronavirus. "

Austria international Marko Arnautovic, who scored the winner from the penalty spot at the weekend, will be the man to watch in the home team, while all De Silvestri, Michael, and Skov Olsen should miss out with injuries. 

The Romans, as expected, defeated Torino at home thanks to Tammy Abraham’s goal. Jose Mourinho’s troops are eager to stay in the Champions League, and we are positive that they will go for a win in the midweek clash. Since Bologna are a real force to be reckoned with at home, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Veretout is banned for the match, while all Spinazzola, Villar, and Cristante are in the recovery room. "

Captain Alessio Romagnoli is banned for the match, while all Calabria, Castillejo, Giroud, and Rebic remain in the recovery room. 

Ivory Coast international Franck Kessie is widely expected to return to the starting XI. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, did well to hold Udinese to a goalless draw at Dacia Arena, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry against Milan. Since the Rossoneri are desperate to return to winning ways, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on the visitors. All Caicedo, Criscito, Destro, Fares, and Maksimovic are likely to miss the game with injuries."

The Nerazzurri faced no difficulties in a 2-0 win over Venezia, with the team melting Milan’s advantage to only one point in the Serie A standings. The reigning champions aim to overtake Napoli in top position as soon as possible, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Bianconeri. 

Lautaro Martinez, who scored as a substitute in the triumph over Venezia, should be recalled to the starting XI, while all Kolarov, Sanchez, Vidal, and de Vrij are likely to miss out with injuries. Spezia, on the other hand, suffered back-to-back losses to Atalanta and Bologna in the last two league fixtures. The Bianconeri have been struggling at the back of late, and we do not believe that they are capable of claiming a major scalp in Milano.

Andrea Belotti should continue to lead the line for the hosts, while all Verdi, Ansaldi, Rodriguez, and Mandragora are out with injuries. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, did well to beat Fiorentina in the Tuscan derby at the weekend. Empoli aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but beating Torino on the road is easier said than done.

Since Maurizio Sarri has a full squad to choose from, home win should be considered. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, head into the match following a goalless draw with Genoa. Udinese are on a five-game winless run on the road, and seeing that Lazio have turned Stadio Olimpico into a real fortress, we predict that the visitors are going to return home empty-handed. There are no fresh injury worries in the away team ahead of the trip to the “Eternal City”. In their last meeting in the Serie A Lazio defeated Udinese thanks to Adam Marusic’s goal."

Midfielder Ruslan Malinovsky is back from suspension, while defender Robin Gosens should be the only absentee in the home team.

All Kjaer, Rafael Leao, Rebic, Pellegri, Plizzari, and Calabria should miss out with injuries for the home side. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, aim to make amends for back-to-back losses to Atalanta and Empoli.

The newcomers, on the other hand, did well to hold Juventus to a 1-1 draw at the weekend. Venezia, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and that is the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on Sampdoria. In their last meeting in Genoa Sampdoria defeated Venezia 4-0.

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, are on an eight-game winning run in the Italian top flight. Inter are eager to retain top position in the standings, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on both teams to score. Hakan Calhanoglu returns to Inter’s starting XI after serving his one-game ban in a 2-1 win over Lazio."
209,2022-01-16,Sassuolo,Hellas Verona,P,"Sassuolo and Verona take on each other at Mapei Stadium – Citta del Tricolore in what is expected to be a close Serie A game. The Neroverdi produced their best display of the season at the weekend, with the team rolling over Empoli 5-1 on the road. Gianluca Scamacca is pushing for a start after scoring a brace in the last league fixture, while all Filippo Romagna, Filip Djuricic, Matheus Henrique, and Francesco Magnanelli continue to miss out with injuries. Midfielder Hamed Junior Traore is on international duty. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a shocking 2-1 loss to Salernitana, but given their poor away record in the Serie A, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Sassuolo. Hongla represents Cameroon at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, while all Ragusa, Bessa, Cancellieri, Coppola, Cetin, Montipo, and Magnani have been tested positive for coronavirus. "
210,2022-01-16,Roma,Cagliari,V,"Roma will be aiming to make amends for a 4-3 loss to Juventus when they host Cagliari to their Stadio Olimpico in the Serie A round 22. The Giallorossi have been struggling at the back of late, but the bookies still see them as hot favourites to beat Cagliari in front of home fans. As always, Tammy Abraham will be the man to watch in the home team, while both Rick Karsdorp and Gianluca Mancini are back from suspension. Midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo has been tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Sardinians, on the other hand, did well to beat Sampdoria 2-1 in their last league match, with the team regaining a much-needed confidence, but seeing that Walter Mazzarri’s troops are not regarded as good travelers, home win should be considered. Defender Henrique Dalbert is back from suspension, while Keita Balde is on international duty. "
211,2022-01-16,Venezia,Empoli,N,"Venezia play host to Empoli at their Stadio Pierluigi Penzo on day 22 of the current Serie A campaign. Venezia are only four points clear of the relegation zone, meaning that their elite division status is in danger. I Lagunari are desperate to return to winning ways, and it seems as if they will not have a better chance than this to do so. Both Tanner Tessmann and Mattia Caldara are back from suspension, while Tyronne Ebuehi is on international duty. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, are on a four-game winless run, and given their display in a 5-1 loss to Sassuolo, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on Venezia. Both Filippo Bandinelli and Sebastiano Luperto return from suspension for the visiting side, while the likes of Fabiano Parisi and Nicolas Haas are out of contention through injuries. "
212,2022-01-17,Bologna,Napoli,P,"Bologna and Napoli face each other at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in what is expected to be one of the most exciting games of the weekend. The Rossoblu have been having their ups and downs in the 2021/2022 season, and, as a result, they sit in the middle of the standings. Home win, though, should not be considered, as Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are hit by coronavirus. 

All Dominguez, Hickey, Medel, Molla, Santander, Vignato, Viola, and van Hooijdonk have been tested positive for coronavirus, while Barrow represents Gambia at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The Partenopei, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Sampdoria, and given the number of absentees in the home side, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visitors. All Anguissa, Ounas, and Koulibaly are on international duty, while Lozano, Rui, and Zielinski should miss out through illness."
213,2022-01-17,Fiorentina,Genoa,V,"Monday’s football game between Fiorentina and Genoa will bring down the curtain on day 22 of the 2021/2022 Serie A campaign. The Viola experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 4-0 loss to Torino, but it is well known that they produce much better showings at home than on the travels. Midfielder Sofyan Amrabat is on international duty, but he should be the only absentee in the home team. As always, a man to watch in the home team will be Arsenal target Dusan Vlahovic, who is enjoying a season to remember. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, have been anything but impressive under new boss Andriy Shevchenko, whose feature is in great danger. Given Genoa’s poor away record in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on the Viola this time out. Nikola Maksimovic is injured for the visiting team, while fellow defender Laurens Serpe has been tested positive for coronavirus."
214,2022-01-17,Milan,Spezia,P,"Buoyed by a 3-0 win over Venezia, Milan will look to stay in the Scudetto race when they take on Spezia on Matchday 22. The Rossoneri are on a three-game winning run in the national championship, and they must be high on confidence ahead of Monday’s clash. All Kessie, Bennacer, and Ballo-Toure are on international duty, while all Castillejo, Calabria, and Romagnoli are rated doubtful for the game after the trio was tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Genoa. Spezia have been producing fine displays on the road of late, but Milan will pose a much bigger threat for the visiting side than their previous rivals. Ebrima Colley represents Gambia at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, but midfielder Kevin Agudelo is back to contention after serving his one-game ban in the triumph over Genoa."
215,2022-01-21,Hellas Verona,Bologna,V,"Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi will host Friday’s Serie A game between Verona and Bologna, the two mid-table sides. The Mastini aim to build on a 4-2 win over Sassuolo, with the team eyeing their first home triumph since November 22, 2021. Both Frabotta and Dawidowicz remain in the recovery room, while a man to watch in the home team will be Antonin Barak, who scored a hat-trick at the weekend. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-0 loss to Napoli. Bologna suffered yet another dip in form, and seeing that Verona have turned their Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi into a real fortress, we predict that Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops are going to return home empty-handed. Soumaoro is banned for the visitors, while all Dijks, Schouten, and Kingsley are out of contention with injuries. In the first half of the season Bologna defeated Verona 1-0, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge."
216,2022-01-22,Inter,Venezia,V,"Inter and Venezia, the two teams who sit in the opposite halves of the table, face each other at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in the Serie A round 23. The Nerazzurri are eager to defend the title, whilst the newcomers are on a quest to secure the top flight survival. Inter dropped two points in a goalless draw with Atalanta, and, no doubt, they are desperate to return to winning ways in the Italian top flight. 

Since Simone Inzaghi should have a full squad to choose from, we are tempted to put our money on the league leaders. Lautaro Martinez is widely expected to return to the starting XI. Venezia, on the other hand, are on an eight-game winless run in the Serie A, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Inter’s party in Milano. The likes of Romero, Mazzocchi, Johnsen, and Haps should miss out with injuries for the visiting side."
217,2022-01-22,Lazio,Atalanta,N,"All eyes will be on Stadio Olimpico when Lazio and Atalanta square off against each other in a highly-anticipated Serie A game. The Biancocelesti quickly bounced back from a 2-1 loss to Inter, with the team rolling over Salernitana 3-0, and, no doubt, the triumph gave them a confidence boost. Cataldi misses out through suspension, while all Pedro, Basic, Acerbi, and Radu remain in the recovery room. A man to watch in the home team will be Ciro Immobile, who scored a brace at the weekend. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, did well to hold league leaders Inter to a goalless draw. Atalanta are eager to stay in the Champions League berth, and given their attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on both teams to score. All Zapata, Gosens, Hateboer, Ilicic, and Malinovskyi are sidelined through injuries for the away side."
218,2022-01-22,Genoa,Udinese,N,"Genoa and Udinese face each other at Stadio Luigi Ferraris on day 23 of the current Serie A campaign. Genoa suffered an embarrassing 6-0 loss to Fiorentina on Monday evening, with the team remaining in the relegation zone ahead of the visit of Udinese. New boss Abdoulay Konko is under big pressure, and, no doubt, his men are going to leave their hearts on the field in Saturday’s clash. 

Mexico defender Johan Vasquez is back from suspension, while all Kallon, Hernani, and Criscito are out of contention with injuries. The Zebrette, on the other hand, faced a tough fixture list at the start of year, with the team losing to both Atalanta and Juventus. Udinese, though, should take advantage of Genoa’s shaky defence. The likes of Silvestri, Molina, and Pereyra are sidelined with injuries for the visiting side. "
219,2022-01-23,Napoli,Salernitana,V,"Buoyed by a 2-0 win over Bologna, Napoli will look to stay in the title race when they host Salernitana to their Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. The Neapolitans are still without Koulibaly, Anguissa, and Ounas, who are on Africa Cup of Nations, with Ospina and Insigne both missing out with injuries. Fit-again Nigeria attacker Victor Osimhen is pushing for a start. Salernitana, on the other hand, are fighting hard to secure the Serie A survival. 

The newcomers, though, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-0 loss to Lazio, and seeing that Napoli are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the underdogs are unlikely to grab something from the match. In the first half of the season Napoli defeated Salernitana thanks to Piotr Zielinski’s goal. To make things even worse for the visitors, all Ranieri, Strandberg, Kastanos, Zortea, Capezzi, Djuric, Cagliolo, Bogdan, Coulibaly, Ribery, and Jaroszynski are out of contention through different reasons."
220,2022-01-23,Torino,Sassuolo,N,"Torino and Sassuolo face each other at Stadio Olimpico di Torino in what is expected to be a close Serie A encounter. Il Toro have been impressive in 2022, with the team recording back-to-back wins over Fiorentina (4-0) and Sampdoria (2-1), but this game will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. All Baselli, Linetty, and Belotti are out of contention with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home side. 

In Belotti’s absence, Antonio Sanabria should continue to lead the line for the hosts. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 4-2 loss to Verona. Since Sassuolo have been playing some high-scoring games of late, we are tempted to put our money on over 2.5 goals. Peluso has been tested positive for coronavirus, while both Filip Djuricic and Matheu Henrique remain in the recovery room. "
221,2022-01-23,Spezia,Sampdoria,V,"Sunday’s football game at Stadio Alberto Picco pits together Spezia and Sampdoria, the two teams who are almost level on points in the Serie A table. Spezia aim to build on back-to-back wins over Genoa and Milan, and they must be high on confidence ahead of the visit of Sampdoria. Colombia international Kevin Agudelo, who found the net in the triumph over the Rossoneri, is pushing for a start, while midfielder Giulio Maggiore serves a one-game ban. 

La Samp, on the other hand, aim to put an end to their three-game losing run in the Italian top flight. Considering that Sampdoria often struggle on the travels, we are going to put our money on the in-form hosts this time out. All Verre, Audero, Yoshida, and Damsgaard should miss out with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away side ahead of the trip to Liguria."
222,2022-01-23,Empoli,Roma,P,"Empoli and Roma face each other at Stadio Carlo Castellani in the Serie A round 23. The Azzurri quickly bounced back from a heavy 5-1 loss to Sassuolo, with the team sharing the spoils with Venezia in their last league match. Empoli aim to put an end to their five-game winless run, and they are likely to fight tooth and nail against Jose Mourinho’s troops. All Parisi, Haas, Marchizza, and Di Francesco are out of contention with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, recorded a very important 1-0 win over Cagliari, with the team keeping their Champions League hopes alive. Considering that Empoli experienced all sorts of problems at the back in their last home fixture in the Serie A, we are tempted to put our money on the capital club. The likes of Spinazzola, Pellegrini, and Smalling remain in the recovery room, while both Cristante and Ibanez are back from suspension."
223,2022-01-23,Milan,Juventus,N,"Juventus will be looking to climb to the Champions League berth when they take on Milan at Stadio San Siro in the Serie A derby. The Bianconeri made a slow start to the season, but they have been producing fine displays in 2022. Max Allegri’s men head into the match following back-to-back wins over Roma and Udinese, but beating Milan on the road is easier said than done. Both Bonucci and Chiesa remain in the recovery room, while Ramsey has been tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, failed to impress in a 2-1 loss to Spezia on Monday. Ivory Coast international Kessie has been sorely missed of late, and seeing that both Ballo-Toure and Bennacer are on international duty as well, away win should be considered. Keep in mind, though, that talented midfielder Sandro Tonali is back from suspension for the hosts. "
224,2022-01-23,Cagliari,Fiorentina,N,"Sardegna Arena will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Cagliari and Fiorentina, the two teams who sit in the opposite halves of the table. The Rossoblu aim to escape the relegation zone, but they will have a mountain to climb on Matchday 23. The Sardinians failed to impress in a 1-0 loss to Roma, and it is no surprise the bookies see them as underdogs in Sunday’s clash. Both Carboni and Pavoletti are banned for the match, while all Lovato, Oliva, Bellanova, Grassi, and Aresti have been tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Viola, on the other hand, rolled over Genoa 6-0 to keep their Champions League hopes alive. Since Fiorentina top scorer Dusan Vlahovic continues where he left in 2021, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visiting side. Benassi and Martinez Quarta should be the only absentees in the away side. "
225,2022-02-05,Roma,Genoa,N,"Roma will look to build on a 4-2 win over Empoli when they take on Genoa at their Stadio Olimpico on Matchday 24.

A man to keep an eye on in the home team will be Tammy Abraham, while Leonardo Spinazzola remains in the recovery room. Both Darboe and Diawara are back from international duty. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, played out a goalless draw with Udinese before the international break. Genoa are not regarded as good travelers, and seeing that they experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 6-0 loss to Fiorentina, we are tempted to put our money on Jose Mourinho’s troops, who are eyeing a place in the Champions League. Cambiaso is banned for the visitors, while both Ghighlione and Rovella miss out with injuries."
226,2022-02-05,Inter,Milan,P,"There will be fireworks when Inter and Milan face each other in the Derby della Madonnina on Saturday evening. The Nerazzurri are leading the chase for Scudetto, but they can’t afford any complacency in the remainder of the season as both Milan and Napoli are breathing down their neck. The likes of Arturo Vidal, Alexis Sanchez, and Lautaro Martinez are unlikely to feature in the local derby as they represented their national teams in the World Cup qualifiers in midweek. 

Both Gosens and Correa are out of contention with injuries. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, head into the match following a goalless draw with Juventus. Milan and Inter seem to be evenly matched ahead of the Giuseppe Meazza showdown, and, taking everything into account, the share of spoils is on the cards. Franck Kessie is unlikely to feature in Saturday’s clash as he is on the verge of leaving the club, while all Ballo-Toure, Kjaer, and Tomori miss out with injuries."
227,2022-02-05,Fiorentina,Lazio,P,"Fiorentina and Lazio go head to head at Stadio Artemio Franchi in a highly-anticipated Serie A game. The Viola continue life without key attacker Dusan Vlahovic, who joined Juventus in the January transfer window, and, no doubt, the Serbia rising start will be sorely missed in Saturday’s clash. His replacement Krzysztof Piatek is widely expected to lead the line for the hosts, while Odriozola misses out through suspension. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, did well to keep hold of key players in the summer transfer window. The capital club aim to move closer to the Champions League berth, and we predict that they will take advantage of the fact that Dusan Vlahovic left Fiorentina. Acerbi and Akpa Akpro should be the only absentees in the away team. In the first half of the season Lazio defeated Fiorentina thanks to Pedro’s goal."
228,2022-02-06,Atalanta,Cagliari,P,"Following back-to-back goalless draws with Inter and Lazio, Atalanta will look to return to winning ways in the Serie A when they host Cagliari to their Gewiss Stadium on Matchday 24. The Orobici are undefeated in the previous four league fixtures, but they need to start winning on a regular basis if they are to represent Italy in the Champions League for yet another term. Keep in mind, though, that all Malinovskiy, Muriel, Pasalic, and Koopmeiners have been tested positive for coronavirus. 

Both Josip Ilicic and Duvan Zapata are rated doubtful for the game, while Alexey Miranchuk remains in the recovery room. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina where they failed to convert a penalty. Cagliari are not regarded as good travelers, and even though Atalanta will be without several first-team regulars in Sunday’s clash, home win should be considered. Important attacker Joao Pedro is banned for the visiting side."

Midfielder Albin Ekdal is sidelined through suspension, while both Yoshida and Damsgaard remain in the recovery room. Midfielder Kristoffer Askildsen is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, played out a 1-1 draw with Torino before the international break. Anyhow, the share of spoils is on the cards in Genoa as Sassuolo and Sampdoria seem to be evenly matched.

Hickey is banned for the hosts, while both Dominguez and Kingsley remain in the treatment room. 

Mbaye represents Senegal at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, but Barrow is back from international duty. To make things even better for the hosts, defender Adama Soumaoro returns to the starting XI after serving his ban in the defeat to Verona.

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, are on a three-game winning run in the Italian top flight ahead of the trip to Venezia. Ounas is back from international duty, while both Koulibaly and Anguissa are still on Africa Cup of Nations.

Veseli is banned for the hosts, while all Schiavone, Ruggeri, Coulibaly, and Stranberg miss out with injuries. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, look unstoppable at the moment, and given their three-game winning run in the Italian top flight, we predict that the visitors are going to emerge triumphant in Monday’s clash.

Salernitana conceded nine goals in total in the previous three league fixtures, and we do not believe that they are capable of spoiling Genoa’s party at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris. All Coulibaly, Schiavone, and Ruggeri are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the visiting team. "
243,2022-02-13,Empoli,Cagliari,N,"Empoli and Cagliari go head to head at Stadio Carlo Castellani in what is expected to be a close Serie A clash. Empoli failed to win the previous seven league fixtures, and, no doubt, they are likely to leave their hearts on the field. All Luperto, Marchizza, and Haas are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team ahead of the visit of Cagliari. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, did remarkably well to shock Atalanta in Bergamo in their last league match. 

The Sardinians aim to escape the danger zone, but beating Empoli on the road is easier said than done. As previously mentioned, a close match is on the cards, and we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on draw. Deiola misses out through suspension, while all Ceter, Nandez, Rog, Walukiewicz, and Strootman are out of contention with injuries. Both Zappa and Altare have been tested positive for coronavirus."
244,2022-02-14,Spezia,Fiorentina,P,"Stadio Alberto Picco will host Monday’s Serie A game between Spezia and Fiorentina, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the remainder of the season. Spezia are eager to secure the elite division survival, while the Viola are eyeing a place in European competitions. Following three consecutive league wins, the Bianconeri shared the spoils with Salernitana at the weekend, and they are surely capable of beating Vlahovic-less visitors. 

The Serbia international was sorely missed in a 3-0 loss to Lazio, and, no doubt, the club chiefs will regret for selling the top scorer in the January transfer window. All Bastoni, Kovalenko, and Leo’ Sena are sidelined with injuries for the home team, while Bonaventura and Torreira are banned for the visiting side. In the first half of the season Fiorentina rolled over Spezia at Stadio Artemio Franchi, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge."

The Bianconeri are determined to book their place in the Champions League for yet another term, and, no doubt, big-money signing Dusan Vlahovic is capable of helping “The Old Lady” meet the goal. 

Danilo, who scored a late equalizer against the Orobici, misses out through suspension, while both Chiellini and Chiesa remain in the recovery room. Torino, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form, and seeing that they failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Udinese and Venezia, we are tempted to put our money on Juve. Both Fares and Praet are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team ahead of the local derby."

All Askildsen, Damsgaard, Gabbiadini, and Yoshida miss out with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, aim to climb to top ten in the Serie A standings. Empoli, though, suffered a dip in form, and seeing that Sampdoria are desperate to escape the danger zone, home win should be considered. The likes of Haas, Marchizza, and Luperto should miss out with injuries for the visiting team, while both Ekong and Baldanzi are back to contention. "

All Coulibaly, Schiavone, and Ruggeri are likely to miss the game with injuries. 

The Rossoneri, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Inter and Sampdoria. The league leaders have found their best form of late, and we predict that they are going to beat the relegation strugglers on Matchday 26. Both Kjaer and Ibrahimovic are sidelined with injuries, while Theo Hernandez is back from suspension. In the first half of the season Milan defeated Salernitana 2-0 at Stadio San Siro, which is yet another reason why away win should be considered."

Mancini misses out through suspension, while both Ibanez and Spinazzola are sidelined with injuries. Experienced forward El Shaarawy is a major doubt. You should bear in mind that Jose Mourinho’s troops are eyeing their eighth home win of the process. 

Verona, on the other hand, continue with their habit of producing much better showings at home than on the travels, and given their anything but good away record in the 2021/2022 season (3-4-5), we are tempted to put our money on the capital club. All Miguel Veloso, Pandur, and Dawidowicz are sidelined with injuries for the visiting team. "

Fiorentina aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and we are positive they will go for a win in Sunday’s clash. Vincenzo Italiano should have a full squad to choose from. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, were on the verge of beating Juventus in Bergamo, but Danilo eventually scored a late equalizer for “The Old Lady”. Since Atalanta are eager to climb to the Champions League berth, we believe that both teams to score betting option should be considered. All Miranchuk, Zapata, and Palomino remain in the recovery room, while Ukraine international Ruslan Malinovsky returns to the starting XI after scoring a wonder goal in the draw with Juve. "
250,2022-02-20,Inter,Sassuolo,P,"Inter will look to overtake Milan in top position in the standings when they take on Sassuolo at their Stadio Giuseppe Meazza on Matchday 26.

Both Bastoni and Brozovic are banned for the match, while Correa and Gosens should miss out with injuries. 

Sassuolo, on the other hand, are on a four-game winless run in the national championship. Considering that the Neroverdi have been struggling at the back of late, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the title holders. Ferrari is banned for the match, while both Toljan and Djuricic miss out with injuries for the visiting team. Over 2.5 goals have been netted in each of their last five meetings in the Italian top flight."

The Zebrette are determined to move away from the danger zone, but their display in a 4-0 loss to Verona is not giving fans a reason for optimism. Gabriele Cioffi should opt to make changes to the starting XI, with both Arslan and Beto pushing for a start. The likes of Nuytinck and Udogie are rated doubtful for the game, and the duo will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Biancocelesti, on the other hand, aim to build on back-to-back wins over Fiorentina and Bologna. Lazio are eager to keep their Champions League hopes alive, and they should take advantage of Udinese’s shaky defence. Both Lucas Leiva and Luis Alberto are banned for the match, while Lazzari and Acerbi should miss out with injuries.

Both Busio and Okereke are banned for the match, while Klyine and Vacca should miss out with injuries. 

Mateju has been tested positive for COVID-19. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are six points behind the safe zone, meaning that they are desperate to grab something from Sunday’s clash. Anyhow, home win should be considered as Venezia proved their worth in the triumph over Torino. Bani remains on the sidelines with injury, but he should be the only absentee in the away team. "

Bologna are eyeing their sixth home win of the process, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at Spezia. Both Medel and Svanberg are banned for the match, while Dominguez, Santander, and Kingsley should miss out with injuries. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, are only two points behind Bologna in the Serie A standings, but given their anything but good display in a 2-1 loss to Vlahovic-less Fiorentina, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on Sinisa Mihajlovic’s troops.

To make things even worse for the home team, all Nandez, Lovato, Rog, Strootman, Walukiewicz, and Ceter should miss out with injuries. The Partenopei, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Inter. Luciano Spalletti’s troops, though, did well to beat both Bologna and Venezia in the previous two away games, which is probably the main reason why away win should be considered.

Inter, on the other hand, aim to make amend for a shocking 2-0 loss to Sassuolo, and seeing that Genoa suit Simone Inzaghi’s troops, away win should be considered.

All Haas, Marchizza, and Verre should miss out with injuries for the hosts. In the first half of the season Empoli shocked Juventus at Allianz Stadium, meaning that the visitors are hungry for revenge.

Keep in mind, though, that Bernardeschi is banned for the match, while all Kaio Jorge, Chiellini, Zakaria, Chiesa, and Mckennie are out of contention trough injuries. 

La Samp, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form, and seeing that they failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Atalanta (0-4) and Udinese (1-2), we are tempted to put our money on the title-chasing visitors. Murru misses out through suspension, while all Supryaga, Askildsen, Damsgaard, and Gabbiadini are sidelined with injuries. "
278,2022-03-12,Milan,Empoli,V,"Milan will look to retain top position in the Serie A table when they host Empoli to their Stadio San Siro on Saturday evening. The Rossoneri are determined to regain the domestic trophy, but both Inter and Napoli are still breathing down their neck. Olivier Giroud, who scored the winner against the Partenopei at the weekend, should keep his place up front, while Theo Hernandez misses the match through suspension. 

All Bakayoko, Kjaer, and Romagnoli remain in the recovery room. The Azzurri, on the other hand, failed to win the previous eleven league fixtures, which is probably the main reason why we are tempted to put our money on the home team. In the first half of the season Milan outplayed Empoli 4-2, which is yet another reason why home win should be considered. Marchizza and Haas remain on the sidelines with injuries, but they should be the only absentees in the away team. "
279,2022-03-13,Fiorentina,Bologna,V,"After sharing the spoils with Verona at the weekend, Fiorentina will look to move closer to the Europa League berth when they host Bologna to their Stadio Artemio Franchi. The Viola continue life without new Juve star Dusan Vlahovic, and, in his absence, January signing Krzysztof Piatek will continue to lead the line for the hosts. Bonaventura is banned for the hosts, while Odriozola is out of contention with injury. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are safe for now as they are 11 points clear of the relegation zone. Sinisa Mihajlovic’s men are stuck in the middle of the table, and given their anything but good away record, we predict that Fiorentina are going to emerge triumphant in Sunday’s clash. To make things even worse for the visitors, Theate misses the match through suspension, while all Dominguez, Vignato, Kingsley, Santander, and Bonifazi remain in the recovery room. Former West Ham ace Marko Arnautovic is a major doubt. "
280,2022-03-13,Hellas Verona,Napoli,P,"Following a heart-breaking loss to Milan, Napoli will be aiming to stay in the Scudetto race when they face Verona in the “City of Love”. The Partenopei are only two points behind league leaders Milan, meaning that Sunday’s clash is of big importance for the visiting side. Fit-again winger Hirving Lozano is pushing for a start, as well as Belgium international Dries Mertens, while both Tuanzebe and Malcuit remain on the sidelines with injuries. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, have been in a fine form of late. Verona aim to extend their unbeaten run to five games, but they face an uphill task in Sunday’s showdown. Since key players are back to Napoli’s starting XI, we are tempted to put our money on the visiting side this time out. The likes of Lazovic, Dawidowicz, Retsos, Pandur, and Praszelik are sidelined with injuries, while Barak is a major doubt."
281,2022-03-13,Torino,Inter,N,"All eyes will be on Stadio Olimpico di Torino when Torino and Inter square off against each other in the Serie A round 29. Il Toro do not seem to be at their sharpest, with the team failing to win the previous six league fixtures. Torino are eager to get back on course, but they will have a mountain to climb in Sunday’s showdown. Pellegri faces race against clock to be fit for the match, while all Fares, Milinkovic-Savic, and Praet are out of contention with injuries. 

The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 5-0 win over Salernitana. Inter are eager to melt Milan’s advantage in the Serie A standings, and they should take advantage of Torino’s anything but good form. Simone Inzaghi has a full squad to choose from, which is yet another reason why away win should be considered. "
282,2022-03-13,Atalanta,Genoa,N,"Atalanta will look to bounce back from a 1-0 loss to Roma when they welcome Genoa to their Gewiss Stadium on Matchday 29. The Orobici do not want to give up on their Champions League dream, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Rossoblu. Luis Muriel should be recalled to the starting line-up, whilst De Roon is banned for the hosts. Duvan Zapata has yet to recover from a long-term injury. 

Genoa, on the other hand, are seven points behind the safe zone. The Rossoblu have drawn each of their last six league fixtures, but seeing that Atalanta are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the relegation-threatened visitors are unlikely to grab something from the match. Both Rovella and Sturaro are banned for the match, while the likes of Cambiaso, Ekuban, Piccoli, Criscito, Czyborra, and Vanheusden should miss out with injuries."
283,2022-03-13,Udinese,Roma,N,"Buoyed by a hard-fought 1-0 win over Atalanta, Roma will look to stay in the Champions League berth when they take on Udinese at Dacia Arena. Both Kumbulla and Mkhitaryan are sidelined through suspension, but Tammy Abraham, who scored the winner at the weekend, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line. Spinazzola remains in the recovery room with an Achilles tendon problem. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, have been showing signs of improvement of late, with the team sharing the spoils with both Lazio and Milan, while beating Sampdoria in front of home fans. Since Udinese are tough to beat at home, we believe that punters from all four corners of the world can find value in betting on draw. Wallace is banned for the hosts, while Nuytinck continue to miss out with injury. "
284,2022-03-14,Lazio,Venezia,V,"Monday’s football game between Lazio and Venezia pits together the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the season finale. The Biancocelesti are eyeing a place in European competitions, while Venezia’s main goal is to secure the Serie A survival. The capital club quickly bounced back from a 2-1 loss to Napoli, with the team rolling over Cagliari 3-0 at the weekend, and it is no wonder the odds for home win have been dropping. 

Montenegro international Marusic misses out through suspension, while both Lazzari and Cataldi are sidelined with injuries. I Lagunari, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in back-to-back losses to Verona (1-3) and Sassuolo (1-4), and they are unlikely to spoil Lazio’s party in the “Eternal City”. Aramu is banned for the visitors, while all Cuisance, Ebuehi, and Lezzerini are out of contention with injuries. Duo Johnsen – Busio will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. "
285,2022-03-18,Genoa,Torino,V,"Genoa and Torino take on each other at Stadio Luigi Ferraris on day 30 of the current Serie A campaign. The Rossoblu have drawn each of their last seven league fixtures, but they need to start winning on a regular basis if they are to secure the survival. Both Rovella and Sturaro are back to the squad after the duo missed the Atalanta game through suspension, while all Piccoli, Cambiaso, Criscito, Vanheusden, and Ekuban remain in the recovery room. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, are stuck in the middle of the table with 35 points in their pocket. The visitors have been impressive at the back of late as well, and, taking everything into account, a close encounter is on the cards at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The likes of Fares, Pellegri, and Praet are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the visiting team."
286,2022-03-18,Sassuolo,Spezia,V,"After dropping two points in a 2-2 draw with Salernitana, Sassuolo will look to return to winning ways when they take on Spezia on Friday evening. The Neroverdi are eight points behind the Conference League berth, meaning that this has to go down as a must-win game for the home side. All Rogerio, Toljan, and Djuricic remain in the recovery room, while Raspadori is banned for the match. 

The Bianconeri, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Cagliari, and they managed to get one, with the team putting an end to their dreadful losing run. Spezia, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and seeing that Sassuolo are eager to represent Italy in European competitions next term, home win should be considered. Both Leo’ Sena and Sala are sidelined with injuries for the visiting side. "
287,2022-03-19,Inter,Fiorentina,N,"All eyes will be on Stadio Giuseppe Meazza when Inter and Fiorentina face each other in the Serie A round 30. The Nerazzurri dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with Torino, and, as a result, they are now four points behind league leaders and their bitter local rivals Milan. Simone Inzaghi should opt to make changes to the starting XI, with both Correa and Vidal pushing for a start, while De Vrij misses the match with injury. 

Brozovic is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. The Viola, on the other hand, defeated ten-man Bologna thanks to Torreira’s goal. Fiorentina, though, have already suffered seven defeats on the road this term, and seeing that key attacker Dusan Vlahovic is no longer part of the team, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Inter. There are no fresh injury worries in the away side."
288,2022-03-19,Napoli,Udinese,V,"Napoli will be aiming to build on a 2-1 win over Verona when they take on Udinese in the Serie A round 30. The Partenopei quickly bounced back from a loss to Milan to keep their Scudetto hopes alive. Napoli are a real force to be reckoned with at home, but they should not underestimate Udinese, who shared the spoils with Roma at the weekend. All Meret, Malcuit, and Petagna are out of contention with injuries, while Juan Jesus is a major doubt. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, are undefeated in the previous four league fixtures. Udinese have been in a fine form of late, but seeing that Napoli do not suit them, home win should be considered. In each of the last four meetings between the two sides Luciano Spalletti’s team emerged triumphant. As for the visiting side, Perez should be the only absentee this time out."

Both Kjaer and Bakayoko remain in the recovery room. 

Cagliari, on the other hand, suffered yet another dip in form, with the team losing to both Lazio and Spezia in the previous two league fixtures. Considering that Milan have been in a fine form of late, we do not believe that the relegation-threatened hosts are capable of grabbing something from the match. The likes of Strootman, Walukiewicz, Nandez, and Rog are all out of contention with injuries for the home side."
290,2022-03-20,Bologna,Atalanta,P,"Bologna and Atalanta go head to head at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in a highly-anticipated Serie A game. The Rossoblu are stuck in the middle of the stable, meaning that they have little to play for in the season finale.

Both Bonifazi and Sansone are banned for the match, while the likes of Dominguez, Santander, and Kingsley are out of contention with injuries. 

The Orobici, on the other hand, aim to move closer to the Champions League berth. Atalanta have one game in hand, meaning that a win over Bologna will see them stay in the CL race. Wing-back Zappacosta misses the match through suspension, while centre-forward Zapata remains in the recovery room, speaking of the away side. "
291,2022-03-20,Empoli,Hellas Verona,N,"Empoli will look to make amends for a 1-0 loss to Milan when they face Verona at Stadio Carlo Castellani on Matchday 30.

Empoli are desperate to give fans some cheer, and they are likely to go all guns blazing at the Mastini. Both Haas and Marchizza are sidelined with injuries, but they should be the only absentees in the home side.

La Samp, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 loss to Juventus, and given their three-game losing run in the Italian top flight, we are tempted to put our money on the relegation-threatened hosts. Both Gabbiadini and Damsgaard are out of contention with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team ahead of the trip to Venice. In their last meeting at the venue, back in 2003, Venezia defeated Sampdoria 3-1."

Lazio want to keep their Champions League hopes as well, and, taking everything into account, both teams to score betting option should be considered.

Towering centre-back Bonucci faces race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s clash. 

Salernitana, on the other hand, came from behind to share the spoils with ten-man Sassuolo in their last league match, but that is unlikely to help them secure the Serie A survival. The rock-bottom side do not seem to be competitive at this level, and we do not believe that they will claim a major scalp on Matchday 30.

Pedro misses the match through suspension, while both Radu and Luiz Felipe are rated doubtful for the match. 

Ciro Immobile, who failed to help Italy qualify for the World Cup finals, will lead the line for the hosts. The Neroverdi, on the other hand, recorded four wins in the previous five league fixtures, and given Lazio’s shaky defence, over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered.

Venezia’s Serie A status is in great danger, and, no doubt, Sunday’s clash could be the turning point for the relegation strugglers. Thomas Henry is back from suspension, while both Lezzerini and Romero are out of contention with injuries. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, aim to build on a thrilling 5-1 win over Cagliari, but seeing that the hosts want this win more than the visitors, we predict that Gabriele Cioffi’s troops will return home empty-handed. Pablo Mari is back from suspension, while both Deulofeu and Perez are major doubts, and the duo will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. In the first half of the season Udinese outplayed Venezia 3-0, meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge."
313,2022-04-10,Genoa,Lazio,P,"Lazio will look to build on a hard-fought 2-1 win over Sassuolo when they take on Genoa at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The Biancocelesti aim to climb to the Europa League berth, and the bookies see them as favourites to win Sunday’s clash. Both Luiz Felipe and Radu are major doubts, but there are no fresh injury worries in the away team. 

The Rossoblu sit in the relegation zone with only 22 points in their pocket. Genoa are desperate to get back on course, and seeing that they will go for a win as well, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Defender Leo Ostigard is back from suspension, but both Cambiaso and Vanheusden remain in the recovery room. In the first half of the season Lazio defeated Genoa 3-1 at Stadio Olimpico, and yet another high-scoring affair is on the cards."
314,2022-04-11,Bologna,Sampdoria,V,"After holding Milan to a goalless draw at San Siro, Bologna will look to return to winning ways when they take on Sampdoria on Matchday 32. Sampdoria footballers will play for head coach Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is struggling with leukemia, and, no doubt, the hosts will leave their hearts on the field. All Kingsley, De Silvestri, and Barrow are sidelined with injuries, while both Hickey and Soriano are rated doubtful for the match. 

La Samp, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 1-0 loss to Roma. The visitors are seven points clear of the relegation zone, meaning that Sunday’s clash is of big importance for them. Taking everything into account, we believe that both teams should be happy with one point from the match. Damsgaard and Gabbiadini should be the only absentees in the away team this time out."
315,2022-04-15,Milan,Genoa,V,"After dropping two points in a goalless draw with Torino, Milan will look to start a new winning run when they host Genoa to their Stadio San Siro on Matchday 33. The Rossoneri are eager to regain Scudetto, but they need to get back on course as soon as possible if they are to turn the dream into reality. Even though all Ibrahimovic, Florenci, Bennacer, Castillejo, Kjaer, Rebic, and Romagnoli are sidelined with injuries, home win should be considered as Genoa are not regarded as good travellers. 

The Rossoblu have collected only 11 points on the road from possible 48, and given their shaky defence, anything but a routine home win would be a major surprise. All Bani, Vanheusden, Rovella, and Cambiaso remain in the recovery room, while fit-again defender Domenico Criscito is pushing for a start after coming as a substitute in a 4-1 loss to Lazio. "
316,2022-04-15,Spezia,Inter,P,"Following a routine 2-0 win over Verona, Inter will look to put an extra pressure on league leaders Milan when they face Spezia at Stadio Alberto Picco on Friday. The Nerazzurri are determined to defend their Scudetto, and we are positive that they will go all guns blazing at Thiago Motta’s troops. Edin Dzeko should keep his place in the starting XI after scoring his 13th goal of the season at the weekend, while fellow striker Lautaro Martinez is back from suspension. 

Defender Stefan de Vrij is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the match. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, played out a boring goalless draw with Empoli. Spezia are safe for now, and seeing that Inter are eager to regain top position, away win should be considered. Both Leo’ Sena and Bourabia are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the home team."
317,2022-04-16,Lazio,Torino,N,"Buoyed by a thrilling 4-1 win over Genoa, Lazio will look to give fans yet another reason for celebration when they host Torino to their Stadio Olimpico on Saturday. The Biancocelesti quickly bounced back from a heart-breaking loss to Roma, and, no doubt, they are brimming with confidence ahead of the visit of Torino. Ciro Immobile, who scored a hat-trick in Genoa, is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line, while there are no fresh injury worries in the home team. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, head into the match following a goalless draw with Milan. Ivan Juric’s men are eyeing their third consecutive clean sheet, but preventing Lazio attackers from scoring at Stadio Olimpico is easier said than done. The likes of Fares, Djidji, Mandragora, Sanabria, Praet, and Zaza are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the visiting side."

January signing Dusan Vlahovic, who scored the winner at the weekend, will be the man to watch in the home team, while Alvaro Morata is back from suspension. 

The likes of Chiesa, Locatelli, Kaio Jorge, and Mckennie should miss out with injuries. The Rossoblu, on the other hand, did well to beat Sampdoria 2-0 on Monday, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry in Turin. Since Bologna have little to play for in the season finale, punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on Massimiliano Allegri’s troops. Both Kingsley and De Silvestri are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the away side."

Cagliari are on a five-match losing run, and, as a result, their elite division status is in great danger. The Sardinians are desperate to get back on course, but they face an uphill task in Saturday’s showdown. Midfielder Alberto Grassi returns from suspension, while all Goldaniga, Ceppitelli, Nandez, and Strootman are likely to miss the game with injuries. 

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, did well to beat Atalanta on Matchday 32 to climb to 9th place in the standings. Sassuolo aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, and given their attacking potential, both teams to score betting option should be considered. Midfielder Davide Frattesi is back from suspension, but right-back Mert Muldur is banned this time out due to accumulation of yellow cards."
320,2022-04-16,Sampdoria,Salernitana,P,"Sampdoria will be looking to make amends for back-to-back losses to Roma and Bologna when they face Salernitana on Matchday 33. La Samp are only seven points clear of bottom three, meaning that Saturday’s clash is of big importance for the home team. Even though all Gabbiadini, Conti, Giovinco, Ekdal, and Damsgaard remain in the recovery room, home win should be considered as Sampdoria will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. 

Davide Nicola’s troops, on the other hand, are on a three-match losing run, and seeing that they will almost certainly drop to the Serie B, home win should be considered. Both Fazio and Bonazzoli are back from suspension, while Ruggeri, Mousset, Perotti, and Coulibaly are likely to miss the game with injuries. In the first half of the season Sampdoria defeated Salernitana 2-0."

The Zebrette have little to play for in the season finale, but, no doubt, their pride will be at stake in upcoming fixtures. Important midfielder Roberto Pereyra is back from suspension, while Santurro remains in the recovery room. The Azzurri, on the other hand, are only two points behind Udinese in the Serie A table. 

Empoli, though, do not seem to be at their sharpest ahead of the trip to Udine, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. As for the visitors, midfielder Szymon Zurkowski serves a one-game ban, whilst all Haas, Marchizza, and Tonelli have been struggling with injuries of late. Earlier in the process Empoli emerged triumphant, meaning that Udinese are hungry for revenge."
322,2022-04-16,Fiorentina,Venezia,V,"High-flying Fiorentina will be aiming to extend their winning run to three games when they welcome Venezia to their Stadio Artemio Franchi on Matchday 33. The Viola impressed in a 3-2 triumph at Napoli, and it is no wonder the odds for home win have been dropping. Argentina winger Nicolas Gonzalez has found his goal-scoring touch of late, meaning that the opposition back-line should have him at bay. Lucas Torreira is back from suspension, while both Odriozola and Bonaventura miss out with injuries. 

Venezia, on the other hand, are low on spirits ahead of the trip to Florence, with the team losing each of their last six league fixtures. Since Fiorentina are a real force to be reckoned with at home, the relegation-threatened visitors are unlikely to grab something from Saturday’s clash. To make things even worse for the visitors, Wales international Ethan Ampadu is banned for the match."
323,2022-04-18,Napoli,Roma,N,"There will be fireworks when Napoli and Roma take on each other at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Monday. The Neapolitans suffered a heart-breaking loss to Fiorentina on Matchday 32 to drop to third place in the standings. Luciano Spalletti’s troops are eager to stay in Scudetto race, and they have no other choice but to go all guns blazing at Roma. Cameroon international Anguissa is back from suspension, while all Di Lorenzo, Malcuit, Ounas, and Petagna have been struggling with injuries of late. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, came from behind to beat rock-bottom Salernitana at the weekend. Since Jose Mourinho’s troops will go for a win as well, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Lorenzo Pellegrini served his one-game ban against Salernitana, while Leonardo Spinazzola has overcome his long-term injury. "

Luis Muriel is widely expected to return to the starting XI, while Marten de Roon is back after serving his one-game ban in a 2-1 loss at Sassuolo. Josip Ilicic remains in the recovery room, alongside Freuler and Djimsiti. 

The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-0 loss to Inter. Verona, though, are not regarded as good travelers, which is probably the main reason why we predict Atalanta will return to winning ways on Monday evening. As for the visiting side, Barak should be recalled to the starting XI, while both Pandur and Dawidowicz continue to miss out through injuries. "
325,2022-04-20,Udinese,Salernitana,P,"Udinese and Salernitana face each other at Dacia Arena in a postponed Serie A fixture. Udinese rolled over Empoli 4-1 at the weekend, with the team extending their winning run to three games. The Zebrette are high on spirits ahead of Wednesday’s clash, but the rock-bottom visitors should not be written off just yet. All Beto, Pereyra, and Santurro should miss out with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

Salernitana, on the other hand, recorded a 2-1 win over Sampdoria in Genoa, which is unlikely to help them secure the elite division survival. The rock-bottom side need to adopt yet another attack-minded approach, meaning that Udinese should have a number of opportunities to seal the victory on the break. The likes of Sepe, Ruggeri, Mousset, Coulibaly, and Obi are sidelined with injuries, when it comes to the visiting side. "

All Coppola, Pandur, and Dawidowicz are out of contention with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

La Samp, on the other hand, suffered a shocking 2-1 loss to relegation strugglers Salernitana at the weekend. Given their three-game losing run, and shaky defence, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on the home team.

Lautaro Martinez is pushing for a start, while there are no fresh injury worries in Simone Inzaghi’s team. 

The Giallorossi, on the other hand, showed character in a 1-1 draw with Napoli as El Shaarawy scored the equalizer in the stoppage time. Jose Mourinho’s troops aim to keep their Champions League hopes alive, and seeing that they face a must-win situation against Inter, over 2.5 goals betting option should be considered. Anyhow, the hosts are closer to picking up all three points from the match as both Fuzato and Zaniolo are banned for the visiting side."

Talented forward Pietro Pellegri is pushing for a rare start after scoring as a substitute in a 1-1 draw with Lazio, whilst all Belotti, Pobega, Warming, Zaza, Fares, and Praet are sidelined with injuries. 

Both Djidji and Izzo are rated doubtful for the match. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-1 loss to Inter. Spezia are eleven points clear of bottom three, and, taking everything into account, we believe that both teams should be happy with one point from the match.

I Lagunari do not seem to be competitive at this level, and, as things stand now, they will find it hard to secure the Serie A survival. Venezia are on a seven-game losing run ahead of Saturday’s clash, and it is no surprise the bookies see them as big underdogs in this one. 

Both Kiyine and Haps are banned for the match, while the likes of Modolo, Vacca, Lezzerini, Ebuehi, and Romero miss out with injuries. The Orobici, on the other hand, failed to impress in the 2-1 loss to Verona, but they will not have a better chance than this to get back on course. Atalanta want to keep their Europa League hopes alive, and we predict that they will give fans some cheer this weekend.

The Sardinians, on the other hand, desperately needed a win against Sassuolo, and they managed to get one thanks to Alessandro Deiola’s goal. Cagliari, though, are not regarded as good travelers, and given the importance of Sunday’s game for Genoa, we predict that the visiting side will return to Sardinia empty-handed. Lovato misses out through suspension, while the likes of Nandez, Goldaniga, Strootman, Obert, and Ceppitelli are sidelined with injuries, speaking of the away team. "

Keep in mind that all Medel, Arnautovic, and Soumaoro miss out through suspension. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, are on a three-match winning run in the Italian top flight. However, the share of spoils is on the cards this time out as Bologna are tough to beat in front of home fans. As for the visiting side, all Beto, Pereyra, and Santurro are sidelined with injuries.

Keep in mind, though, that the likes of Ruggeri, Sepe, Coulibaly, Mousset, and Obi are out of contention through injuries. 

The Viola, on the other hand, look unstoppable at the moment, with the team eyeing a spot in European competitions. Fiorentina are more of a team than Salernitana, and we predict that the visitors will pick up all three points from Sunday’s showdown. Castrovilli remains on the sidelines with injury, while Bonaventura faces race against clock to be fit for the match. In the first half of the season Fiorentina outclassed Salernitana 4-0. "

All Marchizza, Haas, and Tonelli are out of contention with injuries, speaking of the home team. 

The Neapolitans, on the other hand, head into the match following a 1-1 draw with Roma. Luciano Spalletti’s troops dropped two points at the weekend, and, as a result, this has to go down as a must-win game for Lorenzo Insigne and Co. Since the title-chasing visitors want this triumph more than the mid-table hosts, away win should be considered.

A man to watch in the home team will be Ciro Immobile, who scored a late equalizer at the weekend, while Pedro faces race against clock to be fit for Sunday’s clash. 

Patric, who limped off with injury against Il Toro, is definitely out of contention. The Rossoneri, on the other hand, recorded a routine 2-0 win over Genoa to retain top position in the standings. The league leaders, though, will have a much bigger fish to fry in the “Eternal City”, and we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on draw.

Important attacker Andrea Belotti faces race against clock to be fit for the Empoli game."
347,2022-05-01,Udinese,Inter,P,"Inter will look to stay in a two-horse race with Milan when they take on Udinese at Dacia Arena on Sunday evening. The Nerazzurri proved their worth in a 3-1 win over Roma, but they need to keep on impressing in the season finale if they are to defend the Scudetto. Midfielder Arturo Vidal faces race against clock to be fit for the match, while defender Robin Gosens is definitely out of contention with injury. 

The Zebrette, on the other hand, head into the season finale with the lack of motivation. Inter want this win more than Udinese, and we predict that Simone Inzaghi’s troops are going to pick up all three points from the game. Both Santurro and Beto miss out with injuries, while there are no suspended players in the home team. In the first half of the season Inter recorded a routine 2-0 win over Udinese at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza."

The Orobici are eager to represent Italy in European competitions for yet another term, and they are likely to go all-out attack against the relegation strugglers. All Pezzella, Maehle, and Ilicic are out of contention, but there are no suspended players in the home team. Salernitana managed to revive their survival hopes thanks to three consecutive league wins. 

The newcomers aim to give fans yet another reason for celebration, but seeing that Atalanta produced a fine display in a 3-1 triumph over Venezia, home win should be considered. Both Mousset and Coulibaly remain in the treatment room, while Verdi and Radovanovic are major doubts, and the duo will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. In the first half of the season Atalanta defeated Salernitana thanks to Duvan Zapata’s late goal."
349,2022-05-05,Salernitana,Venezia,V,"There will be fireworks when Salernitana and Venezia face each other in a highly-anticipated relegation-six pointer. I Granata were in a fine form in late April, with the team keeping their survival hopes alive. Salernitana are eager to escape the relegation zone, and they should take advantage of Venezia’s poor form. All Coulibaly, Radovanovic, and Obi remain in the recovery room, while the likes of Ribery, Mousset, and Florillo have overcome their respective injuries. 

I Lagunari, on the other hand, made a promising start to the season, but they have been totally out of form in 2022. Since Venezia extended their losing run to nine games at Juventus, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the hosts. As for the visiting team, important midfielder Antonio Vacca limped off with injury in the 2-1 loss to Juve, with Romero, Lezzerini, Ebuehi, and Modolo missing out as well. "

Inter face yet another must-win situation against Empoli, and we are positive that they will leave their hearts on the field. Hakan Calhanoglu is back from suspension, while fellow midfielder Bastoni is a major doubt, and he will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

The Azzurri, on the other hand, head into the match with a severely-weakened squad. Both Stojanovic and Verre are banned for the game, while the likes of Marchizza, Tonelli, and Haas miss out through injuries. Since Empoli failed to impress in a 3-1 home defeat to Torino, we are tempted to put our money on Simone Inzaghi’s troops."
351,2022-05-06,Genoa,Juventus,V,"Friday’s football game at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris pits together Genoa and Juventus, the two teams with entirely different ambitions in the season finale. Genoa are fighting hard to avoid relegation, while Juve are eyeing a top-three finish. The Rossoblu aim to make amends for a heart-breaking loss in the Derby della Lanterna, but they will have a mountain to climb against Massimiliano Allegri’s troops. 

All Vanheusden, Rovella, Piccoli, and Cambiaso are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, booked their place in the Champions League thanks to a 2-1 win over Venezia. Juve aim to overtake Napoli in third position, and they should take advantage of Genoa’s shaky defence. Both Cuadrado and De Sciglio are major doubts, while all Locatelli, Kaio Jorge, Chiesa, and Mckennie remain in the recovery room. "

The Biancocelesti have been scoring goals for fun of late, and they are likely to stick to their attacking style of play. Ciro Immobile, who scored his 27th goal of the season at the weekend, will be the man to watch in the home team, while experienced winger Pedro will be assessed ahead of the kick-off. 

La Samp, on the other hand, are high on spirits following the Derby della Lanterna triumph. Sampdoria, though, are not regarded as good travelers, which is probably the main reason why home win should be considered. As for the visitors, there are no fresh injury worries, but both Giovinco and Gabbiadini remain in the recovery room. In their last meeting in the “Eternal City” Lazio emerged triumphant thanks to Luis Alberto’s goal. "
353,2022-05-07,Torino,Napoli,P,"Torino and Napoli square off against each other at Stadio Olimpico di Torino in what is expected to be a close Serie A encounter. Il Toro aim to build on a 3-1 win over Empoli, but this match will be anything but a walk in the park for the hosts. Fit-again forward Andrea Belotti, who scored a hat-trick at the weekend, will be the man to watch in the home team, while all Zaza, Pjaca, Fares, and Warming are out of contention with injuries. 

Serbian midfielder Lukic is banned for the match. The Neapolitans, on the other hand, proved their worth in a 6-1 crushing of Sassuolo. Napoli have already booked their place in the Champions League, which is probably the main reason why we are going to put our money on draw.

Both Harroui and Toljan remain in the recovery room. Udinese, on the other hand, aim to make amends for a 2-1 loss to Inter.

Rafael Leao should keep his place in the starting XI after scoring the winner against Fiorentina, while both Kjaer and Florenzi remain in the treatment room. 

Zlatan Ibrahimovic should once again start from the bench. The Mastini, on the other hand, aim to move closer to the Conference League berth. Verona are tough to beat at home, but given Milan’s splendid form, we predict that the league leaders are going to pick up all three points from Sunday’s clash. As for the home side, all Dawidowicz, Coppola, and Pandur are out of contention through injuries. "
356,2022-05-08,Salernitana,Cagliari,N,"Stadio Arechi will host Sunday’s Serie A game between Salernitana and Cagliari. I Granata aim to escape the danger zone, and their fine displays in late April are surely giving fans a reason for optimism. All Coulibaly, Obi, and Ribery continue to miss out with injuries, while Radovanovic should recover in time to face the Sardinians. Cagliari, on the other hand, aim to make amends for back-to-back defeats to Genoa and Verona. 

Since the visitors are eager to grab something from the relegation six-pointer as well, we are tempted to put our money on both teams to score. Both Rog and Nandez are pushing for a start, while there are no fresh injury worries in the away team. In the first half of the season the two sides played out a 1-1 draw, which is yet another reason why BTTS betting option should be considered."

Venezia were having their ups and downs in the first half of the season, but they have been struggling in 2022. The rock-bottom side are low on spirits following yet another hard-breaking loss to Juve, and given their shaky defence, home win should not be considered. All Ebuehi, Lezzerini, Vacca, Romero, and Modolo are injured for the hosts. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, are high on spirits as head coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has defeated leukemia once again. Bologna produced fine displays in matches against Inter (2-1) and Roma (0-0), which is yet another reason why we are going to put our money on the visiting side. Both Kingsley and Dijks continue to miss out with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team. "

All Toloi, Pezzella, and Ilicic are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the away team. 

Spezia, on the other hand, suffered a dip in form, with the team losing each of their last three league fixtures. The Bianconeri aim to escape the danger zone, but we predict that Atalanta will take advantage of Spezia’s shaky defence. Croatia international Martin Erlic is back from suspension, while all Colley, Sala, and Leo’Sena remain in the treatment room for the home side. "

Both Odriozola and Castrovilli are sidelined with injuries, but there are no suspended players in the home team. 

The Romans, on the other hand, failed to impress in a goalless draw with Bologna. Since Roma head into the match following the Conference League encounter with Leicester City, tired legs could prove to be a big problem for the visiting side. Fiorentina are a real force to be reckoned with at home, and we predict that the hosts will emerge triumphant in Monday’s showdown. Jose Mourinho can’t count on Armenia star Henrikh Mkhitaryan for the “Artemio Franchi” showdown."
360,2022-05-14,Udinese,Spezia,P,"Dacia Arena will host Saturday’s Serie A game between Udinese and Spezia, the two teams with black and white outfits.

Bram Nuytinck is pushing for a start, while Rodrigo Becao misses out through suspension. 

Both Santurro and Success remain in the recovery room, whereas Beto is a major doubt. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, are only three points clear of bottom three ahead of the trip to Udine.

Faraoni misses the match through suspension, while all Pandur, Dawidowicz, and Coppola remain on the sidelines with injuries. 

Il Toro, on the other hand, suffered a 1-0 loss to Napoli in their last league fixture. Considering that both sides will go for a victory, we believe that there is a big value in betting on over 2.5 goals. Important midfielder Sasa Lukic returns from suspension, whilst all Buongiorno, Sanabria, Zaza, and Fares continue to miss out with injuries.

Mancini is banned for the match, while Armenia international Mkhitaryan remains in the recovery room. 

The rock-bottom side, on the other hand, have not been competitive at this level, and, as a result, they have slim chances of securing the Serie A survival.

Both Ribery and Bohinen are banned for the match, while Ranieri and Coulibaly should miss out with injuries. The Azzurri, on the other hand, failed to impress in back-to-back losses to Torino and Inter.

The Neroverdi, on the other hand, collected only one point in total from the previous four league fixtures. Sassuolo will be with guards down in Sunday’s clash as well, and, taking everything into account, punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on over 2.5 goals.

Nigeria international Victor Osimhen is widely expected to lead the line for Luciano Spalletti’s side. 

The Rossoblu, on the other hand, recorded a very important 2-1 win over Juventus at the weekend to keep their survival hopes alive.
